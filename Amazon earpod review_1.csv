1,RUE030N50F9EJ,B09PYVXXW5,5.0 out of 5 stars Really good with a couple of flaws,CTM,5,"I love TWS earbuds. I have many including buds from Sony, Samsung, AKG, Amazon, Soundpeats and more. I was intrigued by small size of the 1More Minis and wanted to try them. For the most part, they are wonderful. They are literally half the size of my other buds with most of the same features. Remarkable. I don't really like large buds hanging out of my ears and really loathe the stemmed variety like Airpods. These minis almost disappear and their extremely light weight makes them very comfortable. The sound is really good, they have very decent ANC and transparency modes, they have in ear detection and an app for some customization. I have no idea how they can manage to squeeze all of these features into such a small bud. On top of the features, the buds last 5 hours with ANC and 6 hours without. Amazing. I would unconditionally recommend these buds except for two annoyances that EVERY YouTube reviewer has complained about. First, limited customization of tap controls. These don't have single tap capability. I understand that to some degree because the buds are so small that it would probably be impossible to reposition them without stopping or starting your music. The bigger problem is 1More's use of Sound ID rather than ""real"" equalizer controls. Sound ID works by offering A/B samples that you select and it creates a profile based on your selections. It's horrible and doesn't work at all for me. I tried it at least 10 times and the Sound ID profile was always worse than the out of the box sound. I have been forced to use third part equalizers on my phone to get them to sound the way I want. 1More, if you want to keep your Sound ID, please add some presets and a manual equalizer the way many others do like Soundcore for example. I dislike Sound ID so much that it prevented me from buying their new EVO buds. I had the buds in my cart and then cancelled the order. The EVO cost more than the mini and I simply didn't want to deal with Sound ID again. If 1More adds equalization and perhaps allows for more tap options, these buds would be fantastic. As it is, I really like them and will workaround the app shortcomings. 1More, if you are listening, I know you can fix these problems. You can make a great product even greater!","Reviewed in the United States May 14, 2022",AEGYSY5H3ZUJC4SGGPRM3Z2OE5PA,1,32,Color: Black,1MORE ComfoBuds Mini Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Earbuds
2,R385JSD6KWP2QU,B09PYVXXW5,"4.0 out of 5 stars I wish I could rate 5 stars, butâ€¦",Gianna,4,"â€¦I just canâ€™t. Because as useful as these earbuds are, thereâ€™s one huge caveat to them that needs to be made clear.Letâ€™s start with the positive: the ComfoBuds Mini are incredible for sleeping. While theyâ€™re not advertised as sleep buds, I find it hard to believe that they werenâ€™t designed with sleep in mind. The flat shape, the small size, the selection of noise-blocking ambient sounds included in the app, even a sleep timerâ€¦while you certainly CAN use them as everyday buds (and if you have very small ears, you might want to) these are clearly intended for being comfortable enough to wear at night and block out unwanted noises. I love them for that. I previously hated wearing noise-cancelling earbuds at night, which was somewhat of a necessity to me due to my wifeâ€™s snoring problem; with these buds, I ditched the discomfort and pain and accidental button triggering in favor of a much more comfortable experience, to the point where I actually enjoyed putting them in every night. Theyâ€™re not called the â€œComfoBudsâ€ for nothing.The ANC is not the best Iâ€™ve ever tried, but gets the job done as far as helping to seal out those pesky nighttime disruptions. Sound quality is admittedly not the greatest. Donâ€™t get me wrong, itâ€™s perfectly acceptable, it just suffers in a few areas that probably directly relate to the size of the buds. Soundstage is poor, instrument separation is very poor, and the volume tends to skew on the quiet side, but if youâ€™re using these for sleep, none of that matters too much.Now here comes the real caveat.1MORE is clearly having a serious quality control issue with the ComfoBuds mini. I canâ€™t say for certain whether this extends to their other models, as this is the only product of theirs Iâ€™ve tried. And while the idea is fantastic and theyâ€™ve clearly put a lot of effort into the design of these buds, thereâ€™s a persistent issue with one or both earbuds suddenly losing its noise-cancelling ability after a very short period of time, producing whooshing or roaring noises instead of blocking sound.â€œItâ€™s just earwax blocking up the buds!â€ insist the apologist reviewers, as well as 1MORE themselves. â€œClean them and theyâ€™ll be fine!â€ But I beg to differ. With my first pair of these, the whooshing started in the right earbud after about two months of use. I immediately followed every bit of advice I could find about cleaning them, to no avail. I thought, okay, thatâ€™s a bummer, and I sent them back and ordered another pair. The left earbud of the second pair started whooshing within two weeks. I repeat: TWO WEEKS. I had used them less than ten times since I got them, plus I was being very careful about cleaning my ears every day, so there is NO WAY that they accumulated enough earwax during that time to block them up. Something else is going on. I wonder if trying to cram so much tech into such a small package is backfiring, and the components are interfering with each other somehow. Maybe thatâ€™s why you donâ€™t normally see ANC in buds of this size.1MORE will replace malfunctioning buds for you, but the process does take a while, and youâ€™ll be without them in the meantime. It seems theyâ€™re aware of the issue, which is good. I really hope that theyâ€™ll figure out whatâ€™s wrong and release a second version of the ComfoBuds Mini that doesnâ€™t have these problems.I should probably take off more than one star for the quality control issueâ€¦but I just canâ€™t bring myself to. Because when these buds are working, theyâ€™re really the perfect sleep buds, and I just canâ€™t see myself ditching them; nothing blocks out my wifeâ€™s snoring more comfortably than these. I only hope that theyâ€™ll continue to improve in the future. In the meantime, itâ€™s up to you to decide if the risks outweigh the benefits.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2023",AHINA7A6O2I5RZSNAY4OWYN4QXVA,1,31,Color: Red,1MORE ComfoBuds Mini Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Earbuds
3,R1UB1V4EPP9MN3,B09PYVXXW5,"5.0 out of 5 stars Basically perfect, fantastic wind ANC, perfect case",Colin M.,5,"I needed a replacement for my Galaxy buds pro's that have the fatal ANC ""roar in one ear"" that Samsung won't fix, and they don't stay in the ear. Bring an absolutely ENORMOUS fan of the 1more comfobuds z (the single best sleep focused earbuds at any price) I liked that these are also small, the case shape is wonderful (flip top, tiny, wireless charger) and they're relatively inexpensive.The sound quality uses 1more's app to do a ""sounds"" hearing preference test. I would prefer a proper EQ option but it works well enough. I prefer real audiophile iem's and headphones, but enjoyed the Galaxy buds on bass boost, they almost hit like planar magnetics. These are about 80% there. They're totally serviceable, with the only standout being a pretty good technical performance, with genuinely solid imaging and separation. They absolutely do need the soundID set up though, I hate the stock tuning. For tiny little things they are, I am perfectly happy with the sound quality when I want music on my bike or public transit.The ANC is stellar. They have a specific mode for wind reduction that downright curbstomps Samsung and apple. If you ride a bike, you need 1more ANC buds. The transparency mode is great too, very natural sounding. It doesn't have that ""talk and it switches to transparency"" gimmick, but I found it obnoxious on Samsung.Touch controls are easily customized and no ""single touch"" feature means you don't accidentally press anything readjusting or putting them in. Auto pauses when you take one out, your can use just one or the other no problemThe app features depend on the product but these are meant to be usable for sleeping, do they come preloaded with a library of sleep/ambient sounds. I just use my own but it's a nice feature. I can easily fall asleep with them in and I'm a very picky side sleeper, but I do prefer the absolutely microscopic comfobuds z's.The stock eartips did bother me a bit, they have a little ridge from the mold that irritated my ears after a few hours of use. They have a very odd mounting system that I was only able to find one option for, spinfit 1025 tips are shallow enough to fit and still let the case close (the wells for the eartips is a bit to shallow, id like it if they addressed this on a revision) so if you don't like the tips, spinfit 1025's.The case magnets that hold the buds in are hilariously strong. Your have to SMACK it to dislodge them. Very nice detail. The case size is tiny and perfectly shaped to slide into pockets, with a flip top that you can open one handedFor being so small they also stay put well. Not perfect, but I can work out or mow the lawn, an impossible task of the Galaxy buds pro.Overall though, these things rock. They're exactly what I need as a paramedic who also rides a bicycle. 1more is a serious brand with some seriously well thought out products at extremely competitive prices. I can sleep on my side with a podcast and still be able to wake up for a call, they crush wind nose when I'm riding my bike, they sound perfectly adequately tuned with impressive imaging (once you run the sound id feature once) and the case is (slightly too shallow recessions for the eartips aside) very nice in the hand and perfectly shaped.Highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States August 18, 2022",AFG2T5XGMQCACK7JBDRHKEKWJLPA,1,21,Color: Red,1MORE ComfoBuds Mini Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Earbuds
4,RWYK1GXIVV6H1,B09PYVXXW5,1.0 out of 5 stars Decent but Defective,Aquila,1,"UPDATE 6/24/22: As of 6/23/22, my replacement earbuds have the same problem. Sound is reduced then completely lost in the right earbud just a couple of weeks after normal use. Down to 1 star instead of 3 stars. Returning them. Stay within high quality brands like Sony, Bose, and Sennheiser. Replacing them with Sony WFC 500â€™s.UPDATE 6/5/22: Amazon replaced my earbuds after some arm twisting. My updated review is underneath the original:After my cheap but mighty pair of Sony wired earphones finally died after years of use, I decided to do some research and finally try earbuds after years of scoffing at the wireless craze. I decided on these due to having small ears. My first pair of comfobuds mini were defective. The right earbud made a ringing noise as soon as I began to use them out of the box. 2 weeks after purchase, the right earbud had no sound. Max sound volume doesnâ€™t sound very loud unless you have ANC mode turned on. It does not have a proper equalizer. With my defective pair, ANC mode drowned out the melodies even though the bass was good, so the sound wasnâ€™t very balanced. The touch controls hardly work nor are they very customizable. You sacrifice some features that should be included in this price point for the small size.Review for replacement earbuds:The packaging was different. These came in a black box with a manufacture date of 4/2022. My defective pair was in a white box with a 2/2022 manufacture date. Both pairs of the earbuds were black. The touch controls are more responsive and they work 70% of the time instead of the 20% success rate of my defective pair, but the controls are still very limited for the price point. These definitely are as loud as they should be at max volume. Bass is good and the sound is more balanced. The bass in the defective pair was definitely stronger, but it overpowered and drowned out the melodies, making the sound unbalanced and less dynamic. Iâ€™m not sure if this has to do with the pair itself or the firmware. I have been on firmware version 0.10.38 for both pairs and have not yet updated, so it may be the pair itself. Eartips are comfortable but they may be problematic as they donâ€™t create enough of a buffer between your ear and the mesh, so your mesh may get waxy which may impact the sound. Keep them and your ears clean and I recommend buying better aftermarket eartips. Since this is my first pair of wireless earbuds ever, I really canâ€™t accurately measure how good the ANC is as I have nothing to compare it to yet. I ride trains frequently and I never hear my surroundings when ANC is turned on. The battery life seems low at a 4 hour play time with ANC enabled, but the charging case replenishes life fairly quickly. 1more customer service was fine and replied to me quickly, but I ended up getting the replacement faster through Amazon customer service. Overall Iâ€™ll bump the earbuds up to a 3 out of 5 stars. They lose points for the lack of touch controls, lack of a real equalizer, and being overpriced. The sound is decent, the size is great, and they are light-weight and comfortable. While I still prefer the sound quality of wired earphones, Iâ€™ll keep these in my collection if they donâ€™t fizzle out on me too fast again.","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2022",AGFUWY2GO4HF5RMLUR7ZOSKID4KA,1,9,Color: Black,1MORE ComfoBuds Mini Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Earbuds
5,R3FBQBGQM3II4W,B09PYVXXW5,3.0 out of 5 stars I went with soundcore instead,Frankie,3,"So out of the box these tiny buds surprised me. The fit was amazing for me considering Iâ€™m one of those with extremely tiny ears. The sound was okay but after setting up soundid they sounded pretty good with nice bass and clarity. Now on to the bad.ANC.. was alright then I started noticing the left bud wouldnâ€™t function like the right one. A day later whenever anc was enabled the left bud would vibrate and distort sound. Tried resetting and all of that but itâ€™s clearly a hardware issue as it now happens whenever I try to use them. These buds also lack a mono sound when only one is in use. I own many buds and Iâ€™ve never run into that before so when using one bud youâ€™re missing out on a lot of tucked away frequencies. When anc was functioning properly it was eh at best. To me more sound was canceled out with all functions turned off. Iâ€™ve literally only had these for 3 days and theyâ€™re defective already which is a shame because I like the sound and how they fit. Transparency mode was a little much for me especially considering you canâ€™t adjust the volume for it.Touch controls are hardly customizable, Iâ€™m not a fan of only having two tap and triple tap functions.Call quality was actually pretty bad. The person I was talking to would constantly drop out and sound like staticEDIT:Now both earbuds produce a loud buzzing sound whenever using anc/transparency mode. You can hear and feel it, the buds will actually vibrate a bit. They work fine with anc/transparency mode turned off. Would really like a replacement.","Reviewed in the United States October 28, 2022",AEOFU2SCDWYLS6DTSXIR6FWMRQMQ,1,7,Color: Black,1MORE ComfoBuds Mini Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Earbuds

Also, even if they stay connected, these earbuds will stop playing audio when switching from one app to another. The only way I've been able to fix this is to put them back in the case and try again.I was willing to put up with these issues but now audio only comes out of the left side.

8,R2Y5OUH1A0I97F,B09PYVXXW5,4.0 out of 5 stars These are good earbuds,Yamichelle Guzman,4,"I really like these earbuds. Compared to my AirPods 2, the sound isnâ€™t as crisp but has a lot more bass. If you use Spotify, you can get it to sound the same or better than AirPods 2 with the EQ.On the negative side, the ear tips are really poor. They burn my ears after I have removed them and readjusted a couple of times throughout the day.I had ordered both black and white, and the black case came defective, it wouldnâ€™t charge wirelessly, and had a physical defect on the left side.Other than that, after wearing them a couple of hours they seem a bit uncomfortable if not put on properly. It all goes back to the eartips, as I feel I canâ€™t wear them properly if my ears are burning.Be careful around children as these are tiny.

9,RKZ7RXOAQCUT9,B09PYVXXW5,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good, comfortable headphones",Victoria,4,"I'm very impressed with these little earbuds. I bought them because I have noisy upstairs neighbors and needed some noise cancelling headphones to help me sleep. I'm a side sleeper, and while these aren't totally perfect for that, they're comfortable enough that I don't have trouble falling asleep. It helps if you use a very squishy pillow (my memory foam pillow is too firm and makes them dig into my ears). They're very comfortable for regular daily use too. I have an oddly shaped ear canal that makes earbuds constantly fall out of my left ear, but these are small enough that they fit snugly.I'm no audiophile, but the sound is good. Can't complain. They don't sound as good as my Bose headphones that I normally wear, but they're like 1/50 of the size so I can't really fault them for that. I wish the app let you adjust the sound settings manually. As far as I can tell, you can only adjust them by taking their sound preference quiz. The touch controls are a little annoying. The tutorial said you double tap to play/pause, but I've never gotten that to work. They do sometimes randomly pause when I remove or adjust them, though.The noise cancelling works really well. I was kind of blown away by it, since I've never had earbuds with ANC capabilities before. I can't hear the thumping from my neighbors' music at ALL. Way better than I was expecting. It also blocks out the sound of my fan completely. I can definitely still hear sudden, abrupt noises, but it's very muffled. The ""transparent"" setting is also nice, since I like to be able to hear my surroundings when I'm out walking.These aren't marketed as sleep headphones, and I suspect that is partly because of the battery life. They last around 4 hours with ANC enabled, so they won't last you a full night's sleep. Not a huge deal for me since my neighbors usually cool it with the music at around 4am, but it wouldn't be ideal if you were trying to block out a snoring partner, loud AC unit, etc. For the price I didn't really expect much more than that, but it's significantly less than all of the other wireless earbuds I've owned. They do charge quickly, at least.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2024",AFBVU4557EOTGE76S5GLAV5LAAZQ,1,0,Color: Black,1MORE ComfoBuds Mini Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Earbuds

I own my own IT/technology company and I am truly passionate about technology. Simply put these are the best fitting perfect size earbuds on the market. There are no competitors who make earbuds that aren't giant or hang out of medium to small ears. By combining all metrics that earbuds are judged by today the Comfo Buds minis are in a league of their own. The sound quality iis good, noise canceling decent and has the basic features (transparency, basic touch controls) that we have come expect. With that said it's impossible to provide a negative review of these earbuds without attempting to nitpick, are doing a deep comparison in the technical specifics that ultimately most users don't understand. There are very few things in the technology space that are the best at every facet of their market. If you are someone who has smaller ears or just thinks the average size of earbuds is ridiculous than these earbuds are perfect. No they're not top sound quality top noise canceling, top battery life. They are good everywhere. Let's hope 1More is the company that finally drives true innovation in the earbuds market regarding fit and size. Based on price feature set, fit and sound quality the Comfo buds mini have made all my other buds obsolete. My Samsung buds pro, My sound core Liberty pro 3s no longer have a place in my day. I just ordered the Galaxy s23 ultra and in the deal was included a set of Samsung Galaxy buds pro 2. I will update this review once I get my hands on them.My guess is they will be much larger and not have such overwhelming sound quality, ANC and battery life to overtake the 1More Comfo Buds minis. I finally having a full featured small set of earbuds that Make them very convenient for day-to-day use. Let's not forget you can get two or three pairs of these for the price of the ""high end"" brands. If you are a person with common sense you will love these buds. Let's be honest the majority of negative reviews come from people who see themselves as experts , love to talk detailed acronyms and technical statistics or those who don't quite understand how to use the product. FACT earbud size and fit is the number one failure across the earbud market. IMO 1More realized this simple obvious fact and provided a great product at a great price.

12,R9COQUGRFW18X,B09PYVXXW5,4.0 out of 5 stars Common issues people experiene are easily fixed and avoidable,Evan Reeves-Fortney,4,"These are really great earbuds, especially for their size.There are common issues that people run into, which have them replacing the buds using the warranty over and over again before giving up and saying the earbuds seem to suffer from poor quality control or cheap components which fail after a few weeks or months.These issues are a high pitch squeaking noise, and very low volume or no sound. These issues can occur in one side only, or both sides.All you have to do is clean the metal mesh, it's become clogged with your earwax. Trust me, I guarantee that is what the problem is. You have to unclog all the little holes, I used a bristle from a brush which was thin enough to fit. The holes are very tiny.You might start to have volume issues with an earbud not being as loud as the other. It's the holes getting clogged. Once they're all clogged up, you won't be able to hear anything except a very quiet, constant, white noise.The screeching noise occurs when trying to use active noise canceling, while the metal screen is clogged. Don't ask me why, I'm not an expert, but for some reason that's what happens when the mesh is plugged up and you switch to ANC mode. The problem will be completely fixed once you clear out all those tiny holes.Tons of people report these issues occurring after about a month of use, and exchanging them only to run into similar issues with the new pair. It's not the earbuds, it's you. You've got gunk in your ears. You can prevent running into these problems by making sure your ears are clean before using them, cleaning off any earwax after you take them out and before putting them back in the case, and making sure the part of the case where the buds go is clean as well. If you do those three things, you won't end up with clogged up earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2023",AH6X7EA35R6X7XADWWTFB5334ACA,1,30,Color: Black,1MORE ComfoBuds Mini Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Earbuds

I had to return the earbuds. I hope they improve enough in the future that I can invest in them again without these issues.Bluetooth 5.2: Great connection and distance, but in order to connect to different devices you have to go into the device your connected to and disconnect before the other device can connect. My older Bluetooth headphones can release the connection when the new device wants to connect without having to go into the settings like that. (Why no multipoint if they have 5.2?)Also, one bud would randomly disconnect and reconnect occasionally.Call quality is definitely not great, while people said the could hear me fine, the also would say ""what?"" pretty frequently and on my end they sounded so shrill and tinny it was super unpleasant.Noise cancellation was actually really good to me, and the transparency mode was so good it almost felt like I didn't have anything in my ears at all.For dinner reason you can't use transparency mode when only one bud is in. It has to be both buds or not at all.The app crashed frequently. I wish they would allow for more touch control customization. I understand why they chose not to have single tap on these buds but the option would have been nice.Sound quality was awesome for my music, but it didn't carry over to videos and podcasts very well, so having multiple sound profiles would have been nice.The tips suck, not comfortable at all.

While not an expensive earbud option I did expect more for the money. As far as the good I would say they aesthetically nice looking and are very compact. I guess they are as â€œdiscreetâ€ as they can be while not being a skin colored piece of plastic in your ear. Sound quality is fine and battery life is decent. Okay, now for the bad. Unlike basically any other earbud, putting the earbuds in the case and closing it does not seem to be an â€œoff switch.â€ The vast majority of the time they would reconnect while not in use and drain the battery/not charge. Occasionally they would connect to my phone while driving and then I would have to disconnect them and reconnect my phone to car to continue to use my phone to stream to my car audio. They would often just stop while in use with my phone if I got a phone call. I would have to disconnect put in case then take from case to reconnect. Occasionally the listening mode would change on its own from ANC to standard. Overall just bad software/hardware. I only used these for two months and some change and have already replaced them with a superior option for less cash.

Then about 2 weeks in the right earbud stopped working properly; they still charged and turned on, but barely any sound came out. I have had over a dozen pairs of wireless earbuds (I currently have 4 that I use regularly) ranging from the cheapest budget pairs to the most expensive Samsung ones, and never have I had a pair break so quickly.

I'm getting about 5 hours of use per charge, which is nothing to scoff at. The charging case is fairly small. I'm getting a Qi charging pad today so I'll update this review to let you all know whether it's compatible or not.My only complaint is a minor one: the silicon tips that come with these are trash. The driver and tip came apart almost immediately, and for the life of me I can't get them to fit comfortably or stay together. I got some new foam tips which are far better, but the case needs the earbuds to fit very snugly so they won't charge with other tips on.

It has impressive sound from such a small package, can get loud enough to drown out background noise with anc on.The two things that prevent this from being perfect are:One, there is no touch controls that I have found to allow you to control the volume. This is a big deal as I use ear buds to listen to tv at night and I'm unable to use these as the volume is always maxed out with no way to lower..Two, you have to use the case to pair to different devices. This makes it difficult to swap connections, I typically switch between a computer, phone, and tv throughout my normal day. With other earbuds I'm able to put them into pairing mode and easily connect to whatever device I'm using without taking them out or using the case.If they could fix these two issues, these would be the only buds I would use, but I do have to switch to one ov my other sets for tv watching do to the volume control.","Reviewed in the United States March 18, 2023",AGWODMFAPF4W6NOBG6LMLCW2XCAA,1,5,Color: Black,1MORE ComfoBuds Mini Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Earbuds

I can wear a bandana over my ears and no one can't tell I have earbuds as they don't stick out at all. Others claim they're small but they still stick out. I would say everything else is poor and my biggest complain is the lack of quality control. I started getting problems with the earbuds cutting off and sometimes they will get out of sync, which putting them back and pressing the case button three times seemed to fix it it was super annoyning...imagine having soapy hands or just busy and can't take them off right away while you got a mess of sound in your ears, it has lattency when you watch videos too. None of this ever happened with my jaybird vista for the 3 years I had them.Also I noticed that the left earbud led light was not aligned with the orifice like it should, so definetely a quality control issue. When I reset the earbuds the lights on the earbuds flicker but at different rates which lets me to believe something isn't right. Again the left one is flickering randomly faster than the right one. I watched do this for a while and could not identify the pattern...almost as they would somehow try to sync and stop and start over endlessly with no success.

Previous 1More earbuds I have purchased in the past were superbly packaged with great documentation. That was not the case 1More Comfobuds. The sound produced by the earbuds is good, not great. True to their name, they are very lightweight, a plus. But the documentation for this product is unacceptable in terms of the limited amount of information and the absurdly small type in the users manual. The documentation states that the earbuds come with replacement buds of a larger and smaller size, but there were none in my package. Nor is there an app associated with this device which allows you to adjust controls. So between the unreadable manual and the absence of an app, I had absolutely no idea how to adjust. For example, I had no idea how to activate or regulate the noise cancellation feature. I replaced these earbuds with 2nd Gen iPod Pros, at twice the price, but more than twice the value in comparison to the 1More Comfobuds.

So far, these have come the closest. I can wear them for like 2 hours with minimal discomfort. This is a huge upgrade from ""most cause physical pain near immediately"". When placed correctly, they're pretty solid. I couldn't shake them out. They did come loose a handful of times and needed to be readjusted, but in comparison to the others needing that every 5 minutes? I'll take it.They say they have ANC, but honestly, I'm not so sure. In my personal experience, turning ANC on didn't actually cancel any noise. It just brought the bass out. Unless I just can't get the right fit, the ANC mode is effectively just a ""make the music sound better"" button.The drawback here is that you can only use ANC if both buds are in. Not usually a problem, unless you want to pop one in to listen to music and leave the other ear open for communication. The make the music sound better button won't do anything with just one bud.","Reviewed in the United States April 21, 2022",AE7N2ACQHBB3J4PPIM7D3DXGRKXQ,1,19,Color: Black,1MORE ComfoBuds Mini Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Earbuds

From a technical perspective battery life, sound quality, and reliability were my major issues. I knew the batteries lasted less than 8 hours with anc on but personally think 8 hours needs to be the target to get you through long haul flights. Then comes the audio quality which is good but not great they do have an app to adjust the equalizer, though not directly, and it did make it sound better to my ears but still fell a bit flat. The final issue that I have gone through 2 pair in less than a month. It starts off as a low hum/click in the left ear bud when anc or passthrough are active that gets worse over time. It is low and might be missed by many but if you go through the reviews you will find others reporting the same issue. It appears many people either donâ€™t have this problem or it doesnâ€™t bother them so you might get lucky but at the MSRP it wouldnâ€™t be worth the risk for me.On the positive side these buds are the smallest I have ever tried and I love them for that.m. Other than the slight ear pressure I have forgotten they are in. I also have found the ANC is reasonable but donâ€™t perform anywhere close the Sony xm2 headphones.

I confirmed this by putting the earbuds in the opposite ears to confim the issue wasn't with me and also tested wired earbuds to check the phone audio. I assumed that I must have gotten a bad pair of earbuds and returned them and got a replacement pair.Well now after a month of use again the replacement pair is exhibiting the same exact issue! The sound difference is even greater than before. I have no idea why this same exact issue happened and why both happened after just about a month of normal use.I'm assuming this issue can't be happening to all pairs of these earbuds otherwise I'd expect there to be considerably more negative reviews. All I can speak to is my personal experience and personally, I will not be buying a second replacement pair of these.","Reviewed in the United States February 5, 2023",AEGBPKJY4NCBYMUSH5GXTZY2F3HQ,1,0,Color: Black,1MORE ComfoBuds Mini Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Earbuds

I used these for a couple hours and the battery indicator still said 100%, and the sound quality was good. That being said, I found them very uncomfortable to wear and difficult to adjust. I have very small outer ears, and even though these are advertised as being good for small ears I found them very uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. The shape also makes them hard to put back in the case properly and figure out how they should fit in the ear, and I accidentally turned them off a couple times trying to adjust the fit, which was annoying.","Reviewed in the United States February 11, 2024",AEUFMSWBL4XUSCR5OQ4BVPS5Z7AA,1,0,Color: Red,1MORE ComfoBuds Mini Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Earbuds

I looked at the imore comfoBuds Z, but they did not have a microphone and wanted to keep that option in my back up pair of earbuds.I purchased the 1MORE ComfoBuds Mini and they are comfortable - even a bit more comfortable than my airpods 2nd gen. I can reduce the volume to an acceptable 5% - they don't reduce in volume as well as my airpods that can get just a bit lower before muting, but better than any other. I wish they have the timer function that the comfoBuds Z have. The ANC is good. The Transparent listening modes is weird - some ambient noise in my home, like the refrigerator, gets louder.

Tinny sound with no bass. When ANC was used, the sound got even worse and sounded as if it were coming from down a hallway. Oddly, one day the sound randomly improved dramatically. However, a couple of days later as other reviewers have complained they started having a horrific high-pitched squeal in the right earbud before it stopped working completely.Update: Amazon replaced my original pair with a new set. These were infinitely better than my original pair. They sounded completely different than before and quite honestly sounded amazing! Due to their small size I can wear them under my motorcycle helmet which I love. Iâ€™ve really loved these since October. However, the bad news is that once again they have broken. They currently have the exact same issue as my previous pair. The left earpiece has very muddy muted sound. If I turn on noise cancelling there is a loud high pitched squealing. Once again they are unusable. On a positive note when I contacted 1MORE about warranty service they were very responsive.

Today most people don't know their name but they were The company that helped make android what it is today back when windows mobile was installed on 99% of portable devices.The buds are not the best on the market not even close. But these tiny little buds compete with them. Yup at $20 these buds have minimal latency & a rich harmony of sound. They are also pretty comfortable. They take a few seconds longer than preferred to pair each time I take them out of their case but that could also be my device so I don't consider that as a device issue. I've had some that have paired by the time I have the buds in my ear, these are still beeping for a couple seconds. Probably a total of 4-5 seconds total to connect. Not a huge deal but not preferred. They almost never disconnect & give me lossless sound at 15 distance from my device. So when I'm in the house listening to music these are still good. Touch controls are very sensitive so there's no need to press over an over they are very responsive. I bought these prima for music but wanted the voice controls as well. The noise cancelling could use some improvement. Most calls are great, but when in high wind they do not cancel the noise. Over all calls are just fine on these buds but could be a little bit better. I bought these for music anyway. Very small case so they are easy to lose but that's the standard for buds these days so I cannot count that against them either. In the end they sound pretty good across a variety of music genres rock, jazz, pop, classic, rap, blues, & R&B. They are not automatically variable across all audio formats so disparity is present between codecs & quality but most buds are this way even many more expensive ones. Most people just stream music anyway & won't notice the difference because this only matters if you own alot of your own music. In the end these are really good buds worth more than they are sold for. These aren't cheap buds these are solid quality buds. Htc hasn't sacrificed quality.

They keep lowering the quality of them. This generation of this product isnt worth having. The touch/tap controls simply don't work. It doesn't matter what the instructions say - it's only on/off.In addition, they're sensitive. Brushing against your ear (not tapping on the earbud) will stop your media or hang up your calls and in some frequent and infuriating cases - disconnects your earbuds from Bluetooth altogether. But tapping on them will not reconnect anything. :))))))I hate these I'm not buying them ever again.~~~~~(This product on the left. previous product, now removed,on the right.)My review for the previous model was a glowing review. The sound quality was great, the range was great, and an earbud *went through the washing machine* and still worked. 5* and chefs kiss.

The sound is not as great as the last model but this *is* about $10 cheaper. When in pairing mode - the earbuds make a loud beeping sound, nonstop, until paired. The downside is that you can't put your earbuds in and then pair Bluetooth because the noise hurts. The beeping is not loud enough to find a missing earbud.All in all,Cheers to HTC for making a product affordable and yet still better quality than the competition.","Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2022",AG3PFW7Q45G3N2MJJ3A2W5MKWQ6A,1,3,Color: Black,HTC Wireless Headphones Bluetooth 5.1

I like them to be compact to fit under my helmet, have loud enough clarity that I can hear them over my bike's engine, be touch sentitive and not a button, and most importantly, be able to skip song tracks with a long button press as opposed to a double click. These fit every single box. They even make a light to let you know when you've changed tracks. This is important to me so I can tell when I successfully did skip to the next song and not accidentally pause my music instead. They were so close to perfection. Except for one major problem that ruins it for me. Any small drop, matter how light, will break it. I once dropped a bud while sitting down onto thick carpet and the sound went out in it. All other functions worked except it made no noise. I figured I got a defective product and Amazon was happy to replace it. I loved my second one until I dropped it on my bed and the earbud died again. If the maker made them any more durable, I would happily buy a third pair. They have good sound quality, are compact, great battery life, and have all the functions I want. However, any drop over 15 inches, no matter the surface will break their sound. Every other function in that dropped earbud will work but it will be completely muted. I truly wish I could give this product the 5 stars it deserves but after going through two of the same earbuds with the same issue, I simply can't do so. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 solely because of the audio and ticking off all my boxes. Unfortunately, because of it's fragility, I can't give it any better.

They're not expensive, and I was hoping for the typical good HTC experience I had gotten after owning several of their phones. These things kind of suck if you're trying to live life while using them. First, they put all the weight on the top of the bud, which means that any head movement loosens them in your ear. I tried all the sizes of cushion, and none of them keep them in my ear canal for more than a minute or two if I'm walking. I constantly have to push them back in. If my hands are full, for example - bringing groceries into the house, one or both will fall out. Riding my bike yesterday, I had one fall out on the cement trail, bouncing into the weeds. I stopped quickly which caused the other to fall out. I spent 6 minutes looking for the damn thing before finding it. I tried switching left and right which allows them to sit sideways in my ears, and it's a little bit better, but not enough. Also, they cut out a lot. If my phone is in my pocket just above my knee and I'm walking the sound cuts out to the rhythm of my steps. Charming. Same with riding my bike. Have to put it in my shirt pocket. Have not had this problem with other Bluetooth headphones.In conclusion, if you're in a coma, playing dead, or part of a freeze flashmob, they're pretty good. If you are a normal person with stuff to do, you'll want to punt them into the great beyond.","Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2022",AHIT3XW2OZWRQDQTV5DDR3Y25HQA,1,1,Color: Black,HTC Wireless Headphones Bluetooth 5.1
112,R1JIE1PQSH8QQ6,B09H27SXHS,3.0 out of 5 stars Fits well in ear canal; not the best during calls,Trisa81,3,"I was excited because I love HTC products. This could be because this was a ""used but very good"" item so please consider that when reading this review:GREAT when listening to music, videos, etc. Slants perfectly into ear canal, app is a good bonus. Every person I called kept asking me to repeat myself because I either sound muffled or unclear...it was so frustrating regardless of adjust volume and other settings in the app. You are able to use one earphone at a time and still hear music clearly and the instructions provide directives on how to use the touch feature while listening to music and during phone calls. I considered purchasing a brand new pair but did not think it would be worth the price and went to a different brand.","Reviewed in the United States March 31, 2022",AEEOKK6XEEHY6KOZVB6SF2AKNMUA,1,0,Color: Black,HTC Wireless Headphones Bluetooth 5.1

The feel was cheap and they broke after dropping them. The sound was eh but absolute trash. I had to use the warranty to get a new pair and same issue. I had to eventually buy a new pair and I decided I wouldn't ever buy raycons again and since these were on sale for $60 I decided to give them a shot. I knew JBL was a great speaker and headphones brand so I wanted to give them a try. Omg they are the best earbuds I've ever had. They're so easy to connect to ur phone and you can change the sound profile from the app. The sound cancellation is like nothing I've ever had even better somehow than my gaming headphones I think. The bass is unreal!!! The sound clarity and everything is incredible. Best earbuds I've ever had. They are durable too. They feel like good quality and the case is perfect. It feels good it snaps shut and has a good satisfying feel and sound when it does. It fits perfectly in my pocket and the charge life is so fricken long I can go a week without charging it and it still has life. I've had these for about a month and only charged them maybe twice. I'm so happy with the way these are id highly suggest buying these. Especially over raycon earbuds. I'm so happy I helped people not waste their money on that crappy brand. Someone I talked to even canceled their order to buy a pair of these and thanked me because these were on sale for way cheaper. But even at base price for only a few dollars more why not buy quality?

202,R11OSJ184YK5L8,B09FM6PDHP,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound quality,Amazon Customer,5,"This review is representative of my first impressions after receiving the item.Fit - 4/5: While I've had better fitting earbuds in the past, I would say that these aren't problematic at all, but not perfect either. The buds fit fairly snugly in my ears, and its quite nice that they've included a few tips. They don't seem to move around if I shake my head, so I have decent confidence that if I take them to the gym or on a run, I wouldn't have problems. That said, they don't quite fit perfectly, but everyones ear is a bit different so others might find it better or worse.Sound - 5/5: All I can say is wow do I love the sound that these produce. The level of bass is far beyond anything that I've had from my other earbuds (Jabra Elite 65t and Jlabs JBuds Air). The app includes equalizer settings that actually make quite a lot of difference (unlike other headphone apps I have used) and I am blown away by how much bass can come from these headphones. I have also noticed with other wireless buds that they tend to be on the quiet side, not reaching the same volume that my larger Sony headphones can, but that is not at all the case here. These get LOUD. As someone who plans to mainly use these for workouts, this is exactly what I hoped for.Battery - 5/5: So far I have not had a chance to use these until they die, so I have to disclaim that. However, if the battery matches up or comes close to their claims, which I expect they will given it is a reputable brand, then I will be impressed. My other buds max out at around 8 hours, so getting almost 4x the total battery life is excellent. 8 hours without recharging is very impressive.Look and feel - 3/5: The case looks nice and I think the aesthetics are fine. But the buds themselves are polished smooth, which makes them a bit tricky to handle with your fingertips. Once they're in, its no problem. But a matte finish or some texture would have been better for usability.I'll update this review if I find any reason to, but I am extremely impressed by the headphones, especially for the price point.

So they get an A plus for adjustability in that regard.I love the color, I chose navy but there many to choose from.

Again very happy with the quality but more importantly for me is the battery life, these are very comparable with the higher end jlab buds that will last me the entire work day and have enough juice in the case so that I'm not having to charge them multiple times a week. These are amazing in both categories. And lastly you can listen to each bud independently which is a must for people like me that usually only wear one.

205,R1PDE5V244R06D,B09FM6PDHP,"5.0 out of 5 stars At 50% or more off, these are great.",Dru Ha,5,"I have one pair for work and one for home/going out. I wouldnâ€™t have spent $100 on each pair but at $50 per pair theyâ€™re a good deal.The ANC is pretty impressive for little earbuds. Makes the background sounds in an IHOP at 9:30 on a Sunday nearly disappear. They also eliminate the sound of snoring dogs and humans.Took a recent trip on an airplane and opted to bring these instead of my Sennheiser Momentum 3â€™s. Iâ€™m an audiophile on a budget. They canâ€™t compete with the over-ear Momentum for sound reproduction. But for earbuds theyâ€™re a great product at the sale price.There is a JBL app you can download to your smartphone but the controls are reasonably intuitive. I have big fingers so I probably miss the sweet-spot for function control more than the average person. Iâ€™ve found the bass to be a little lacking but I think thatâ€™s due to the EQ setting Iâ€™ve selected. You do have some EQ presets to choose between in the app.They come with three sets of the rubber earplugs for various sizes of ear-canals. Medium worked for me. I can use them to sleep, travel, shut out the loud noises in restaurants, and for Zoom calls.Consider the color you want to stand out against your bedding when they fall out if falling asleep with them in.I like them enough that I bought a second, dedicated pair for work.The ANC has three settings but so far I havenâ€™t found one that totally mutes audio output from your device in the â€œambient-awareâ€ or â€œtalk throughâ€ modes. Thatâ€™s a feature I like on my Momentum. It can be accomplished by the extra step of just pausing playback with a tap on the right, then tap the left to toggle through the three ANC modes.They work great with an iPhone as well as Windows 10/11 computers.Much greater clarity the the JLAB go, which donâ€™t seem to have any functional ANC. I should have spent the extra money at the get-go.Buy them when on sale. Theyâ€™ll probably be fine for you.If ANC and a variety of EQ options are the most important features for you, spring for the current $300 - $400 Sony over-ears. I have a pair of those in the house-too. Their ANC is better but for the music I listen to the Sennheisers are #1. However I would recommend the Sonys for over-ear for the average listener and these for travel, etc. itâ€™s a lot harder to lose a big set of cans than earbuds so I donâ€™t want to invest too much in these little guys.JBL has always served me pretty well for the price in the pro-audio and live sound amplification area so I had some confidence in the name when I bought these.","Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2023",AFUR62MXQUALQJX5LDFW3KOQBQLA,1,99,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - True Wireless In-Ear Headphones

These things really get me through the day with their ambient sound control, great sound quality and omg talk about battery life! This being saidâ€¦.About a month ago my right earbud started having connectivity issues with my Bluetooth (while my left earbud functions normally) and now has completely lost the ability to gain charge. So Iâ€™ve basically been down to one earbud which doesnâ€™t allow any of the ambient sound controls and is honestly kind of annoying!I really never write reviews for anything, but Iâ€™m genuinely devastated because I loved these JBL earbuds so much and I really needed these to last me longer than 5 months.

207,R3U67WG7KC37BZ,B09FM6PDHP,"5.0 out of 5 stars Wow, these are good sounding earbuds",Mike,5,"There are review sites around that test headphones and earbuds and as far accuracy in frequency response and imaging, these earbuds outrank most other brand's more expensive earbuds.I have the JBL Tune 600BTNC headphones which are a great over the ear headphones and these earbuds sound just as good and even a bit clearer. That's hard to do. Both, these 230NC and the 600BTNC have bass between 20Hz and 100Hz elevated by 3db to 5db, the 230NC being a bit more accurate. That's Ok because I like my bass a few decibels higher.These earbuds have really good punch as well as ultra low bass down to 20HZ. Comparing these 230NC to your subwoofer is a great way to see how good or weak your subwoofer is. Since these 230NC earbuds are accurate from 20Hz to 60Hz within 1db or +4db above 100Hz, most subwoofers can't provide the bass these earbuds can.The clarity in the midrange and treble is great, and without elevation to make music sound bright and fatiguing.I have tried the JBL Club Pro Plus and Tune 125TWS and neither would seal correctly or be comfortable to wear more than 10 minutes. Mainly because of the big club at the end of the actual ear piece. Those earbuds don't fit good in every ear because they are big. The 230NC doesn't have club at the end of the earpiece but a small thin stalk like most ""wired"" earbuds that fit everyone good. These 230NC with their long thin stalks fit my ears good and seal good, plus they are actually more comfortable than my 600BTNC headphones. The Club Pro Plus actually hurt my ears and left them in pain for an hour after only wearing them for 10 minutes.These 230NC earbuds sound great, seal good, and are comfortable enough to wear for hours. I don't see doing any better than some $300 earbuds or headphone for sound quality.The one thing they fall down in and so do my 600BTNC is that they use the lower class active noise cancelling instead of the adaptive noise canceling. Honestly they sound great even in a noisy plant with the active noise cancelling.For the price slashing Amazon does to the retail price, they are a bargain IMO.The only thing I wish they had was function to test if they are sealed correctly like the Club Pro Plus had in it's app. That way you know you are getting the maximum bass response that these earbuds can produce. I simply test using music with ultra low bass that I'm very familiar with.","Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2023",AF7UFK3GWNSBHUXMPCXJM5LZIKJA,1,38,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - True Wireless In-Ear Headphones
208,R21G2QA3DWXAWV,B09FM6PDHP,4.0 out of 5 stars A satisfactory pair of earbuds with a decent attempt at noise cancellation,Tonigiri,4,"In this review, I will compare the jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds with some of the best wireless earbuds of 2023, based on four criteria: noise cancellation, sound quality, battery life, and design.Noise cancellation: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds have active noise cancellation, which works well in most situations, but may not be effective in very loud environments. The Sony WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds are the best in this category, with outstanding noise-canceling performance that adapts to your surroundings and personal preferences. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 are also excellent, with adjustable noise cancellation levels and a transparency mode. The Apple AirPods Pro 2 is another good option, with effective noise cancellation and spatial audio support.Sound quality: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds deliver a decent sound quality, with a balanced and clear output. However, they may not satisfy audiophiles who prefer a more detailed and dynamic sound. The Technics EAH-AZ80 wireless earbuds are the best in this category in my opinion, with a superb sound quality that rivals some of the best over-ear headphones. They have a rich and balanced sound signature, with deep bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. They also support high-resolution audio codecs and have a dedicated app for EQ customization. The Sony WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds are also great, with a dynamic and engaging sound that can be tweaked via the Sony Headphones Connect app. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 are also impressive, with a top-notch sound quality that is well-balanced and natural. Keep in mind that the jbl 230 nc sits in a very different price point than the earbuds above so it's still punching way above its weight in this regard.Battery life: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds have a battery life of about four hours, which is average for wireless earbuds. They come with a charging case that can provide an additional 12 hours of playback. The Sony WF-1000XM5 wireless earbuds are the best in this category, with a battery life of up to eight hours with noise cancellation on, and up to 24 hours with the charging case. They also have a quick charge feature that can give you an hour of listening time with just 10 minutes of charging. The Apple AirPods Pro 2 are also good, with a battery life of up to six hours with noise cancellation on, and up to 30 hours with the charging case. They also support wireless charging and have a fast charge feature that can give you an hour of listening time with just five minutes of charging.Design: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds have a simple and sleek design, with a matte black finish and a jbl logo on each earbud. They are lightweight and comfortable to wear, with three sizes of silicone ear tips to choose from. They are also water-resistant, which means they can withstand sweat and rain. The Apple AirPods Pro 2 is the best in this category, with a sleek and ergonomic design that fits snugly in your ears. They have an open design without tips, which means they don't block out the outside sound completely. They also have force sensors on each stem that let you control music playback, calls, noise cancellation, and voice assistants. The Beats Fit Pro wireless earbuds are also stylish and comfortable, with a winged design that keeps them secure in your ears. They have an IPX4 rating for water resistance and have touch controls on each earbud.Conclusion: The jbl 230 nc wireless earbuds are a decent pair of headphones for casual listeners who want to escape the noise of the world. However, they are not the best in any category, and they face stiff competition from other models that offer better performance and features. If you want the best noise cancellation, sound quality, battery life, or design, you may want to consider other options such as the Sony WF-1000XM5, the Technics EAH-AZ80, the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2, or the Apple AirPods Pro 2. At this price point however, which is often lower (I bought mine on sale for 50% off), the jbl 230 nc is a no-brainer and will give you a value you can't say no to.","Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2023",AEFYG6AEEKPWIUMDM2IYUSDK2FLA,1,140,Color: WhiteStyle: Headphones,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - True Wireless In-Ear Headphones
209,R1PQYT04HC2P7L,B09FM6PDHP,"4.0 out of 5 stars Had high hopes, jury is still out.",Shonna,4,"I bought these to replace my skullcandy sesh Evo. I had the skillcandy for over a year & recently I lost the left bud & then the right ear bud decided it was gonna be finicky about charging. Like the sensor wasn't connecting properly anymore. It was getting super frustrating because I only had 1 ear bud left & when I wanted to use it it would either be dead or only give me a few minutes. After watching many reviews on YouTube & reading them here I decided I'd get these JBL ones as they had good reviews & *bonus* they were on sale for $49.00. I am on day 3 of using them. Around my house I normally only wear 1 ear bud so I can still keep an ear on my kids. I used the right ear bud all day yesterday, sticking it back in the case when not in use. Last night I went to use the left ear bud & it didn't automatically connect when I took it out like the right one. When I had both out it connected so I put the right back in the case. When I woke up this morning I went to use the left one & the app said it only had 20% battery even though it was in the charger all night. In messing with them I realized even in the case the left was still connected & playing. I finally got it to connect to the charger & work properly. But I feel like it shouldn't be this difficult. It's not rocket science placing the ear buds in the case. I am using these for music, podcasts, & watching shows. The sound is great. I haven't made calls with them. They fit comfortably in my ear, I like the black sleek color. I am just hoping I don't continue to have charging or connection issues as I will use these EVERY SINGLE DAY all throughout the day.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2024",AEB4PHJN3LWFAU3TMAW2QU6XRTIQ,1,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - True Wireless In-Ear Headphones

211,RU17Y1H4GO22E,B09FM6PDHP,4.0 out of 5 stars Worked great...for just short of 2 years,Quicksilvur,4,"I think I spent at least $100 on these back in September '22. I wanted to replace a former set of earbuds with something more substantial and higher quality. I really love all that JBL does (I have purchased their FLIP bluetooth speaker as well and it's fantastic).However, for some reason, everything just crashed and burned suddenly. First, the left earbud stopped charging altogether (no light shows up even after cleaning the contacts). Then the charging case went entirely dead after just charging it to 100%. So I'm figuring it's the end. Sadly.I had figured a mid-priced brand would be a nice middle ground (somewhere between Tribit and Bose lol). I am not a power user and am very careful with my earbuds, so maybe this was just as long as these were going to live. I will keep buying JBL, but have to unfortunately add my voice of disappointment on these earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AEEKDCHLNPFK4YGNYN6QNS3JLYSA,1,7,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - True Wireless In-Ear Headphones

226,R2ALTJFGTU9XEY,B09FM6PDHP,"4.0 out of 5 stars Best battery life, Great noise cancelling, awkward fit in case",N8,4,"I have only used wired headphones for years. This is the first time I've ever purchased Bluetooth wireless ear buds - so, know going forwards that I don't have anything to compare these to.That being said, I do have a few pairs of Bluetooth wireless headphones, and I'm making some assumptions, based upon these.So, the first thing I'll say is that the Noise Canceling feature in these is downright amazing. I mean, for something so small to be able to block out so much noise is just quite unbelievable.In addition, the Ambient Aware mode is quite amazing as well, as you can literally hear everything around you, while still hearing the music quite clearly - you can tell that a lot of R & D went into these.The Talk Through mode is also good - although I think it makes the music so low that you really can't even hear it - but it is handy in case you need to have a conversation. I've had a conversation with Ambient Aware mode turned on, and I can hear the other person just fine.Okay, here is where I'll start making some assumptions. I don't have another pair of BT earbuds to compare to, so I'm assuming that other companies would create apps similar to the ones for their BT headphones when making apps for their ear buds.The JBL app is my favorite one. It's very easy to get into, has some settings you can change (like what each ear bud does when you touch it certain ways), as well as allows you to change the audio mode that you've enabled.Now, I have a pair of Anker BT headphones, and they are really comfy, but the app is nowhere near as feature-rich as the JBL app is.I guess if there is anything that I don't like about these it would be the inability to turn them off without using the app. You can set them to time out after a set amount of time, so they would turn themselves off at some point, but I think that is a waste of the battery, so I use the app to turn them off.Another thing I don't like is the case - the ear buds fit into it in a very awkward way - I'm always having to twist my wrists to get them in correctly. I think this was a major design flaw, but it's minor compared to all the other benefits of these.One thing I absolutely love on these is the battery. I've used these for about an hour, turned them off (via the app), kept them outside of the case, and come back to them a month later, and they are still at the same battery percentage as a month ago - unbelievable.I should also mention that the battery lasts a fair amount of time when actually listening to them. I use these when working out, and they last plenty of time for me to run and lift weights.I've never actually tried to figure out exactly how long they last on one charge, but if I'd have to guess, it's probably upwards of 5 hrs at least.To save battery power, I usually put mine in a ziplock bag, along with the case - so that the battery gets to run-down without being recharged all the time. I only put them back into the case when the battery is actually low.The case also charges very quickly (as do the ear buds as well).So, overall, I'd highly recommend these ear buds. They have some minor issues that I've discussed, but in my opinion, the pro's far outweigh the con's for these.If you found this review helpful, please click on ""helpful"" or the thumb's up.Thanks.","Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2023",AEVRSFNYMIZ3OQFLXTDUEWLZW7YA,1,283,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - True Wireless In-Ear Headphones

Sitting on my bike with the engine running but not moving the active noise cancellation seemed to work very well - I couldn't hear the engine at all, actually - but once I started moving things weren't quite so rosy. It seems the active noise cancellation is just a tad too slow to respond to wind buffeting noise because the music is horribly distorted as if one is listening to speakers through the spinning blades of a fan. Unfortunately, with the active noise cancellation turned off the silicone cup style earplugs don't do near as good a job of passively blocking ambient sounds as the silicone triple-rib style earplugs on the MiPeace (or the Elgin's I replaced these with), so I reluctantly returned them.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2024",AFULIFC3V2ECRHMU7GIFX6PYSOHQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - True Wireless In-Ear Headphones

Also I felt the fit of the JBL earbuds were more comfortable than Sony which are much smaller.Note its important to turn on the noise cancellation feature and also adjust your music preference in the EQ settings... through the JBL app for the best outcome.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AEVW4FF2PZC6HAC2Y4PSS5R4NPRQ,1,26,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - True Wireless In-Ear Headphones

(So great for shopping during the holidays, you can block out all the crowd chatter and repetitively Christmas music!)- Ability to switch noise cancellation modes is easy! (So you can optionally listen to people speak while cutting out a few decibles like fan noise.)- Build quality is solid!- The JBL app works flawlessly!- They connect to phone and other devices easily, total plug & play!Cons:- They tend to disconnect more often, which isnâ€™t that annoying per se â€” except it makes a beep sound to alert you that something is wrong. (The Apple earbuds just turn off, so thereâ€™s no jarring loud beep in your ears.) This is especially annoying when it happens in the middle of a song.- This one is weird â€” If you hold the two earbuds in your hand, and they touch in a certain way, it makes a loud chirping noise. (Almost like the feedback of two microphones being too close together.)- Theyâ€™re kind of bulky, and fall out of my ears more often than the Apple AirPods did. Even after changing the rubber tips. (The bright side is that because theyâ€™re so bulky, theyâ€™re easier to find on the ground.)- Though you can use the JBL app to find your earbuds, it doesnâ€™t help you find the charging chase.Conclusion:- For $50, Iâ€™ll keep â€˜em! The sound quality is truly excellent enough to look past the weird quirks.And if they get lost, as most earbuds often do, it wonâ€™t break my wallet to do so. (The Apple ones are comfy and have less quirks, but kind of overrated at that price point.)So I would buy JBL earbuds again â€” though I might look into the smaller models, that maybe (hopefully) arenâ€™t as prone to pop out of the ear like a cartoon bean.","Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2023",AFZYWTX4DWEYTGWMVJVRWCJBXPIA,1,50,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - True Wireless In-Ear Headphones

254,R1IG9HV4RNJRWA,B09FM6PDHP,3.0 out of 5 stars Disappointing,Ken,3,"There are several things I like about the JBL 230. The sound quality is pretty good and the noise cancelling is excellent for this price range. So, if you're in a noisy office or work environment, these may work for you. The battery life is great, and the JBL app provides a good equalizer for customizing your sound. I love the blue color, and the touch controls work, even if finding that ""sweet"" spot takes a bit of practice.What I don't like is that every time you put the earbuds in, they start in the ""Ambient Aware"" mode (sounds around you are amplified). It's great, if you want to hear what Margret down in accounting thinks about Bob's new haircut from across the room, but I hate it. I'm typically putting in earbuds to block out the sound around me, not to make it louder. Plus, the Ambient Aware function uses battery life. I'd much rather have the ability to start in a ""normal"" (non-amplified) setting, but that's not available. You have to start with them active and either open up the app to turn it off or set the buds to use a touch feature to turn it off (meaning you can't use the touch feature to control your music, change volume or anything else).My second gripe is around the microphones and wind. Any slight breeze makes it impossible for you to be heard at the other end of a phone call. I'm often outside and I simply can't make phone calls if there's a breeze. Likewise, driving with the windows down while on the phone is a no-go. The wind drowns out everything else. If you happen to have Ambient Aware turned on (remember, it's the default?), it amplifies that wind noise in your ears, as well, even if you're not on the phone. This is a real deal breaker, and everyone from Apple to Samsung and Sony do a much better job of limiting wind noise on phone calls with their buds.There are other minor things. The buds are very lightweight, which is good, but they stick a little too far out of my ear, so they're always getting knocked loose. They sit in the case with the speakers facing outward, so you always have to turn them around when taking them out or putting them away, since most people are designed with their ear canals going *in* to their heads (this design makes zero sense). The app is slow to load. You can't do anything in the app until it finds and connects to your buds, so you have to have at least one bud in to use the app for anything, which is weird (I can't even view the app right now to tell you about it because my buds are at home, so the app won't open), and many app features aren't accessible unless you have both buds in.I really wanted to like these, but the inability to use them in 90% of the cases I want them just makes them worthless to me.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2023",AFKKJU65DENPLES5WGHT46LVPJJA,1,129,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - True Wireless In-Ear Headphones

Countless times i've jumped because my husband is behind me and I didn't hear him... when its just in my ears they are also very quieting. But you hear a small amount of pass through... The clarity is amazing, the fit is perfection. I do not like that it has a harder time connecting bluetooth to two different devices where my airpods i could easily switch between the two. I also don't like the fact if they aren't 'on' in the app you can't search for them.

This case is so slippery. I am someone very mindful of my electronics and have never so much as cracked a phone screen, but I can't even count how many times this case has just slipped out of my hands or off of a surface. The charging lights on the case have began to malfunction. I like these earbuds, but I would recommend storing the case in a pouch or something with a little more grip to it.As for the earbuds themselves, they're great. I've had them for a year now and they work wonderfully. The audio quality is great, not the best but worth the price. They fit into my ears wonderfully and don't slip out easily which is quite rare for me. The Bluetooth range also seems to be quite large and I never have issues with that.One other thing is that the battery has definitely dwindled rapidly in the past year, but I use these earbuds everyday for at least a few hours, so that's to be expected. I don't mind charging them more often. The earbuds themselves still last about five to seven hours on a full charge, which is absolutely perfect for me.I like these earbuds a lot.

Then I tried different plugs for my ear size, and I was amazed with the sound quality and noise cancellation. The JBL application works well; you can adjust the earphones' volume mixer. In case you canâ€™t find one or both of the ""buds,"" there is a button to find them with the loud sound from the earbuds. They are easy to use; you donâ€™t need to press some buttons to connect to new devices; you just open the cap and connect. It connects super fast to devices.I a bit didnâ€™t like the case and itâ€™s cap as it does not feel solid, but it works fine. I use the buds everyday for several hours and they can work 8-10 hours without charging from case, the case can charge buds 4 maybe more times, i have never counted.It is portable, and the range of Bluetooth is great, but the white color can easily get dirty.

286,R3CQL0C7IB5R18,B09FM6PDHP,3.0 out of 5 stars Ambient Aware white noise,Adam,3,"Edit: Dropping original 5/5 for both earbuds to 3.5/5. Connectivity problems occasionally. I had the microphone just straight up gave up in the middle of a call and had to restart my computer to get it back to work again, unpair and pair didn't work. Occasionally, they randomly disconnect for a second or so, like every couple of hours on average. When that happens, there's a chance for one ear bud to be slightly delayed than the other, and has to unpair and pair to fix.If you use both earbuds all the time, then it's great for $50-60. 5/5Comfortably fit in my ears and don't fall out much when jogging. They'll still fall out when the moving is too much, but that's unavoidable in any earbuds like this. ANC works wonders. The sound quality is good for the price. Microphone is hit and miss like every other earbud out there, but generally works well.If you ever use just the right earbud, then it's awful. 0/5The ambient aware gives out a very audible white noise all the time. And it will automatically be turned on if you only use the right earbud. You cannot turn it off because the ambient aware setting is on the left earbud only. You can only turn that off in the phone app. But if the earbud is not connected to the phone, then you can't change it.One work around is to go to the phone app and let both earbud to have the ambient aware on off functions, but you will lose the right earbud's play/pause function. And you need to turn it off every single time you use it.The connection chime and setting change chimes are extremely loud and I can't find a way to lower the volume. So that's further annoyance. This applies to both single and both earbuds modes.I personally hate these and will be returning the earbuds.

That would be a pair of L26 speakers, I purchased on lay-a-way, when I was 16, back in 1976 for $875. That would be over $6000 in 2023 dollars. Later I purchased JBL's J2050 Book-Shelf speakers and later still JBL's Media 100 Desk-Top speakers. I guess you would say, I would recommend JBL products, since I've had a 48 year relationship with their brand.I was on the brink of returning the JBL Tune 230NC TWS True Wireless In-Ear Noise Cancelling Ear-Buds but decided to contact JBL Customer support, to find out why I was unable to connect my ear-buds to my TV. I submitted a fairly detailed explanation, sufficient for their support staff to realize I was already paired to my phone. So I learned that ear-buds come in single-pairing and multi-point-pairing. The JBL Tune 230NC TWS True Wireless In-Ear Noise Cancelling Ear-Buds are single-pairing, which is just fine for me. These ear-buds can be very immersive, watching TV or Listening to music. The noise cancellation does a nice job of muffling surrounding noise. I had taken them with me on walks to listen to music or books-recordings and I became a bit concerned at how much of the sound around me was deadened. You then have to keep your head on a swivel.As these are my first ear-buds, I don't know if this is common but while out for a walk, the microphone ports, built into the ear-buds, pick up and transmit the sound of the wind scouring the microphone ports.","Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2024",AGJRRXVA43IHAW4WHREBWAXE2GYQ,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones,JBL Tune 230NC TWS - True Wireless In-Ear Headphones

303,R3UK6JSSN2LFZ2,B09HN594TL,4.0 out of 5 stars Good inexpensive earbuds.,nekoBasu,4,"I recommend these as an inexpensive earbud set.I like that they're red, so that stand out on my messy desk.I needed a new set to of earbuds, and decided Apple wasn't getting any more of my money in this space. I'm not thrilled with the longevity or support apple provides for their airpods pro.I found these on a list of of good cheap earbuds, and I'm happy. They work fine at the gym. out of the box, with the default rubber ear tips, I ran a mile on the treadmill this morning and I didn't fiddle with these once (for fit). They stay right where they're supposed to, which is not something I can say for airpods pro or another pair of earbuds I'd been using at the gym.These are not audiophile grade headphones. if you want that, keep looking. They do isolate pretty well. The base on the bass boost eq setting is just ok. But the sound is balance enough that it's not overly ""tinny"". I hate cheap speakers, and these don't sound too cheap. So while it's not the finest sound ever, it's still far from junk.Technically, coming from airpods, there are two downsides I've noticed (both survivable).1 - with my fingers - the buds themselves are very hard to remove from the charging case. If I never had owned airpods, I'm not sure I would know this. on the other hand, I think they seat really nicely in the case, and thus they always charge. The airpods famously don't always connect inside their case and sometimes aren't charging when you think they are. I'm ok with it, and I assume I'll eventually learn the ""trick"" to pulling these guys out with ease.2 - these were very easy to pair to my iphone. HOWEVER, unlike airpods, once these are paired to a device, they CANNOT be paired to another device unless they bluetooth connection is disconnected from the first device. e.g. with airpods, you can go back and forth between a macbook, an iphone, and an ipad, simply by selecting the airpods from the device. With these, if I was using them with my iphone, and then I want to use them with my ipad, I need to turn bluetooth off on the iphone for a moment until the buds are ""free"", and then I can connect them to my ipad. Sub-optimal, but not a deal breaker for me./a few pluses.1 - I can side-sleep with these in and they don't hurt. yay.2 - I love that the usb charging plug is integrated into the case. last thing I need is more cables.3 - again, for me, they fit well. Snug, almost to the point of being too big, but they don't bother me. I'm really impressed that they just stay put while I'm running and I don't need to constantly push them back into my ears for fear that they'll fall out./I haven't really had these long enough to have an opinion on the battery life.I haven't tried using these for calls yet, so no opinion on the microphone.","Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2024",AGILVFT4SJ2DBC5KKWH6WSVY6LGQ,1,123,Color: RoseStyle: Pop,JLab Go Air Pop True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds
304,R3UWOH4RB5J595,B09HN594TL,5.0 out of 5 stars UPDATE: First Impressions,MayBae,5,"UPDATE:My AirPods are dying and have been constantly dropping Bluetooth with my phone, so I borrowed these from my daughter to wear for the day. I have had the right bud in for 7.5 hours and the battery percentage (which actually does show up on my phone screen in the control center) shows that I still have 40% battery life left. I also have not dropped Bluetooth once (!) and they still feel comfortable and light in my ear. Iâ€™m pretty astounded, actually. My AirPods would have died hours ago. The only issue I had was when I received a phone call. My phone rang, as well as hearing the ringing through the earbud, but when I answered, it did not automatically connect to the earbud at all. I had to talk into the phone normally. I also have noticed a distinct difference in the bass level between these and the AirPods. I donâ€™t know how much of it has been the slow death of the AirPods, but these sound so much better than the first time I tried them. 10/10. Do it.Old Review:I heard these were a pretty decent earbud set for the price and decided to try them out as a backup set. Iâ€™m coming from AirPod Pro (1st Generation) and prior to that, the Jabra 75t.I have to admit, this isnâ€™t bad for a $25 set of earbuds. One of the reasons I switched from the Jabra 75tâ€™s (aside from the fact I had to get warranty replacements TWICE), was because I wanted to be able to use each earbud interchangeably and Jabra did not have that at the time. Iâ€™m actually quite surprised that JLab included the functionality for this price point. The charger being built into the bottom of the case was a nice touch and I appreciate that both earbuds go in the case magnetically, as well as the lid being magnetic as well. It paired easily with my iPhone 15 Pro and my daughterâ€™s iPad.These are definitely lighter than both my Jabras and Pros. They fit in the ear nicely and I could see myself being able to wear them for a while (doing most things) and not have them fall out. My ears must be different sizes because my Pros consistently fall out of my left ear, but stay pretty good in my right ear.There isnâ€™t an app for these, so while you can change songs, adjust volume, and use Siri by pressing the buttons on the earbuds, you wonâ€™t be able to tweak any part of the sound. You also will not be able to check the battery percentage and will have to go off the audio prompts it gives you. These also do not have noise-cancelling capabilities (which I honestly wouldnâ€™t expect at the low price).So, hereâ€™s where Iâ€™m taking off one starâ€¦the sound. Iâ€™m not an audiophile. I donâ€™t typically listen to music so the majority of my use is podcasts, audiobooks, or YT/Twitch vids. The sound is a bit muted (â€¦not an audiophile) and not quite as clear as my Pros. For that reason, I likely will not use them unless I need to charge both my Pro earbuds at the same timeâ€¦and both my Jabraâ€™s are dead, haha. They would be fine in a pinch, but not something I would choose if my Pros are available.I also cannot speak to the battery life as I havenâ€™t used them for more than a couple minutes, but what they promise (32 hours) is extremely impressive. I ended up giving them to my daughter to use as she only has over the ear headphones. I will say itâ€™s a great first set of earbuds for kids as you do get a lot of great features in a lower priced set.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2024",AFM6HO7FF4655PMXN7TUUKEIJ6UQ,1,7,Color: LilacStyle: Pop,JLab Go Air Pop True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

The left bud is a-ok. Really this didn't last (note: i did get these used-like new and i have used them a bit) as long as I'd hope but it doesn't change my opinion. For the price (say $19.99) you can do better .. even if you have to wait for say a lightning deal on something like the TOZO T6's for $22.99 or something ... BUT ... i'd not say ""these are horrible, avoid"" ... the sound isn't the best like i said but they are small and really comfortable ... and while they dont have the best sound ... i have heard FAR worse ... just a little EQ'ing and these sound decent for relaxing music (one of my main uses) .. for podcasts or something ... that doesn't matter as much anyway (EQ'ing them) .... I will update this if i find its an easy fix but even a few resets hasn't gotten the right but to turn on yet.April 2023 Update: well ... I see these are $23 now ... I dont think they are worth that much (just a few $1's too high, dont get me wrong) ... but I got mine used-like new for $12.50 and I have seen them say at the $16 or so range ... you know .. these aren't 'great"" but they are not that bad. I think say for podcasts or whatever they are fine ... you can just find better for music (even ""jlab signature"" and eq'ed on top). having said that ... I have used these at night for sleeping and they fit great. I HAVE gotten use to being careful with the built in cable (still not a fan of that though ... if a cable breaks you can replace it... if this breaks, your charging case cant charge the earbuds).I hate to act like any of the buds I still have are ""not comfortable"" but for me, comfort wise, these are up there. As long as you dont expect these to be top quality buds (NOR worst of the low price buds, again dont get me wrong) .. I think people may like theseUpdate 2+ condensed) After using these for a bit, and even counting the best EQ option (Jlab Signature) and a v-shaped EQ on top via Wavelet (app) these still do not sound as good as some other pairs i have, however using them for side sleep (whatever side faces the pillow DOESN'T have an earbud in), these do a surprising good job at passive noise cancelling for me. While they also dont sound the best... they dont sound ""bad"" either ... you can some real no-name duds below $20, .. these are decent for that sub $20 price range to be clear.I gave these 3 out of 5 stars but really its maybe between a 3.5 TO MAYBE a 3.75 to be clear ... maybe more toward 3.5 in my book though. I'd say look at TOZO first for deals ... but I still recommend these.They are comfortable to me too ... like they dont feel too big ... just right.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 1) I did notice one day when it was REALLY humid the controls seem to get wonky ... like sometimes my presses weren't ""registering"" and then others would which would mean i'd do a function (change track for instance) when i wanted to change the EQ mode instead... it doesn't alway happen but it has once or twice in constant use since i bought these.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------i have to say the default tips + the size of the buds combo are nice ... I have ( .. even just to test THESE) been using these sleeping at times rather than my TOZO T6's and while i love the T6's i haven't found the ""perfect"" eartips for them that fit me (so to speak) ... at times with these Go Air Pops ... I hardly notice they are in my ears ... I didn't even open the little bag with the other tips to make sure (note: bought ""used - like new"") I got the other tips, yetmy one con that I REMEMBER typing this update is the sound quality ... .ok for the price on ""JLab Signature"" EQ but bang for your buck ... counting deals on Amazon ... you may be able to do better.So far Battery Life seems decent enough ... a little shorter than I expected but like i said i am using these for sleep and i count that time that I am sleeping so .... yeah battery life is good for the price, I'd say--------------------------First I want to mention this is all based on my first impressions after a few hours of use, only â€¦ things may change later. Bluetooth Earbuds I have are TOZOâ€™s T6â€™s and NC2â€™s (two pair now), Fiilâ€™s T1XS with app support, and Edifierâ€™s TWS1 Pros and Earfun wise the Air Free Pro 2â€™s, (Returned due to a number of issues) Earfun Free Miniâ€™s and to be clearâ€¦ Earfun Freeâ€™s that were sent to me unexpectedly after they saw my review of the Free Miniâ€™s (thank you Earfun) â€¦ point being is that I have experience with a number of earbuds even if I do use some more than the others (no real particular reason).Right away I noticed these opinionsPros- Fit â€“ to be clear none of the buds I have are really â€œuncomfortableâ€ in any way but these just fit good, with the default tips â€¦ or what I am guessing is the default tips (comparing them to the default TOZO T6 tips, they seem the same size) â€¦. Unless my ear starts to itch or something, I HARDLY notice the Go Air Pops are in my ears. I love my TOZO T6â€™s (form factor wise the nearest on the list I mentioned, to the same form factor as these)â€¦ but these just seem to fit a little better.Update a few days later (after writing the prior paragraph) â€“ these while they have fallen out from time to timeâ€¦ these are very comfortable. When using them for sleep (whatever side of my head faces the pillow if â€œside sleepingâ€ doesnâ€™t have an earbud in) â€¦ they are more comfortable then the TOZO T6â€™s I have used for the same thing before and with these there are times I barely know they are there, and I really like that.- Build quality â€“ I will not say these have â€œgreatâ€ build quality .. that just seems to be overstating it but these do not feel as cheap as the Earfun Air Free Miniâ€™s. Some ultra budget earbuds have a quality where it just feels like the cheapest plastics and materials were used â€¦ not the case with these buds, even if they donâ€™t scream â€˜high end qualityâ€ either.- Battery Life â€“ I am not going to act like I have counted or even really paid attention but these seem to last awhile and even after falling asleep for a bit with theseâ€¦ I cant say I have ever woken up to them NOT playing â€¦ since I bought them I had to charge them once and (just in case, I probably didnâ€™t have to) then a second time, just to make sure the case was fully charged at that point, but I just had no idea the caseâ€™s charge then and it could have been say 70% or something and the second charge was un-needed.Iâ€™d say I am â€œimpressedâ€ by the battery life being good.------------------------------Pros/Con (??) â€“ This may be my least favorite sounding earbud I have but â€¦ from what I remember of the Earfun Free Miniâ€™s â€¦ they do sound better than they did â€¦ and I love TOZO but I can not compare these with the TOZO A1â€™s which I donâ€™t have â€¦. say comparing these to the TOZO T6â€™s seems sort of unfair as the A1â€™s (TOZO brand wise) are more of the equivalent to the Go Air Pops. They could sound the same for all I know.I do notice a difference using the built in EQâ€™s (note too that no matter the headphone or earbud I tend to have an EQ setting or app with a â€œUâ€ to a â€œVâ€ setting applied) â€¦ but not much â€¦ I do agree that the Bass Boost mode CAN muddy things up at times â€¦ the Flat EQ setting â€¦. makes it a lot flatter sounding (no matter what I listened to) than I was expecting â€¦ I mean FLAT sounding â€¦ NOT â€œneutralâ€ like Iâ€™d describe the TOZO T6â€™s for example.The best setting between the three is Jlabâ€™s Signature sound which boosts the Bass and the Treble in a V like sound signature. Like the Fiil T1XSâ€™s many EQ options and customization, for instance are nice to have, in my view â€¦ the default sort of â€œVâ€ signature THEY offer is also the best THEY sound. If I am not mistaken .. the â€œJlab signatureâ€ sound EQ setting IS the default and it does sound the best, like I said.After a few days and a â€œside-by-sideâ€ comparison to the TOZO T6â€™s I have (some of the others are in a higher price bracket â€¦ I am trying to be fair here) the T6â€™s do sound â€œsharperâ€ and â€œcrisperâ€ â€¦. sort of hard to describe if you donâ€™t get what I am saying â€¦ however, forgetting these I got â€œused-Like newâ€ for $12.50 â€¦ Iâ€™d sort of say they are worth $19.99 (typical price) â€¦ but Iâ€™d HONESTLY spend a tad more for the T6â€™s â€¦.if someone did ask me about these â€œgo air popsâ€ ...â€yes or no, at 19.99?â€¦ no commentaryâ€ â€¦ Iâ€™d say yes â€¦ if you note the conâ€™s (below)----------------------------------------------------------------Cons- The built in charging cable. - I do have to admit I KNEW about this before hand and this was not a surprise â€¦..A) the length â€¦ I mean many earbudâ€™s cable that comes included IS short, but this seems extra short. I may pickup usb â€œextension cableâ€ to use with these buds which ACTUALLY may solve the other issue â€¦. anyway I just do not like how short this is, where depending on how you are ABLE to charge this, the case has to be dangling somewhere with all the weight of the buds and the case on the built in cable. To keep it as a built in cable I know they HAVE TO make it small or double/triple the size of the case itself â€¦ that makes sense to me â€¦ but Iâ€™d just rather have a say separate USB-C port + cable for instanceB) I didnâ€™t even think of this at first but with the prior Jlab model that didnâ€™t have a top on the case (not sure whoâ€™d like that design idea) â€¦ but the built in charging cable the way Jlab has it, has the bottom (even when itâ€™s tucked into the case) pins exposedâ€¦ .this seems like a really bad idea for dust/dirt/etc to me but for the record I have only just gotten these and NOT had issues with this yet â€¦ just something that seems like an oversight or something.- Max Volume - this may or may not always be an issue but especially if you have audio that is not normalized (the default level of the source audio is too low vs what it should be) ... the max volume of these earbuds may not help.I never truly paid attention to reviews saying how loud certain buds are, but I do notice that compared to some earbuds, the MAX volume of these or even ""on tick down"" from max is what i have it on a bit (note: sometimes i do have a black Honeywell fan on next to me) .... when some other buds ... say oh 70% to max (guessing, but it's close) is good for me volume wise. Again this is not always an issue with good source audio or if your not in a loud/noisy place-----------------------------------------Summary (again based on first impressions)I think if you count lightning deals there may be better options when others go on good sales, but these arenâ€™t bad. I can â€œdeal withâ€ the sound not being the greatest, but that charging cable A) being so short and B) the pins being completely exposed I do not like and maybe a deal breaker for some.I canâ€™t say I 100% recommend (I mean counting deals there are better options out there .. even for a LITTLE BIT more in price)â€¦ nor can I say I donâ€™t recommend (even with issues like I said) â€¦ they arenâ€™t bad â€¦ as a backup pair or if you are just curious about theses â€¦ Iâ€™d say go ahead and give them a shot.","Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2022",AHSKKWKFQ2CEAY2OXB7YBOKFD2KA,1,283,Color: BlackStyle: Pop,JLab Go Air Pop True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

309,R1Y33AFMMLBEV0,B09HN594TL,"4.0 out of 5 stars For $25 they're pretty decent, but there could be room for improvement.",Nightweeb92,4,"I've mostly ever bought Skullcandy headphones as they were generally my ""go to"", I went through about four of their sets before getting fed up with their odd spec listings at certain prices and annoying customer service and warranty.I needed something decent but cheap. The go air pop ended up being a popular choice so I picked them up. Generally I mainly use them for commutes and mowing the lawn (my ears start ringing after long periods of time with a lawnmower so I listen to music to avoid it).The price is great, getting these on sale is even better. They're super light weight and the fit is perfect and they stay in my ears pretty well if I'm not doing extenuous activities that make me sweat, otherwise I'm often pushing them back in, but I do sometimes have a small hassle getting them out of my ears and sometimes the case itself too. They fit in my ear a little too well that I sometimes have to get a good pinch grip to get them put, sometimes it feels like I'm not even wearing them.The build is about as expected, made with a higher grade plastic, they don't particularly feel expensive but they don't feel like dollar store cheap either, they look pretty decent ..though for the case I do wish there were a few changes. For one being the USB cable, instead of having a proprietary cable, they should just have a USB-C charging port instead. Additionally, it would've been nice to get maybe another 1 or 2 LED battery indicators in the front instead of the single one to let users know how much battery life is left in the case.On the inside they should add a recessed section to make it easier to pull the buds out of the case, I sometimes don't have good grip and the buds feel slippery, so I feel like I need to twist the buds to get them out. As for the flip top, they could make the recessed lip a little deeper, the case itself is decent but it's a little too slim that you sometimes fumble with keeping It open to get the buds out, it's sometimes just as slippery as the buds.The touch controls are pretty straight forward and easy to get used to.Sound is good ..if you're mostly into bass heavy stuff, they have a bit of clarity and some detail, but they're not something an audiophile would approve, they're just good general consumer quality. The original go air pop don't have an app so the only customizing users are limited to are the three built-in EQ settings, jlab signature/balance and bass boost.The Jlab signature sound is balanced with a slight bump in bass and treble, they're recommended as a universal sound that sounds good with just about anything. But to me it lacks clarity as some frequencies sometimes tend to mask or overpower other frequencies causing a loss in details.Balanced, is basically a flat meant for things like listening to audiobooks and podcasts, there's more focus and emphasis on boosting vocals while everything else remains relatively flat.Bass boost, is more for people who want more bass ..on top of what already feels like a more than enough bass sound from the Jlab signature sound. It's more meant for working out, but it does have a tendency to overpower the mids and highs most of the time and is the least detailed.Overall sound is good, stick with the Jlab signature sound and that's all you should really need. What the regular go air pop lacks is an EQ to help bring in more details. The Go pop+ is the same model but with a USB-C cable attached and allows connection to the Jlab app for custom EQ.One small gripe I have in color is that they don't have a mint color available for this set (or maybe not yet).And my other small gripe is this only support SBC audio encoding and not AAC which is a step up in audio quality. Yes that means the Go pop+ too only supports SBC. At this price I can't expect this to have something like LDAC support, but the inclusion of AAC would've been nice.Despite my gripes and nit-picks, for the price these are pretty decent and I'd recommend them if you're looking for something decent but cheap, I personally recommend going with the updated Go pop+ as they're the same as the go air pop but with app support and USB-C.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2024",AHBH456GHSTRY32NAQBKZU6SJY5A,1,6,Color: SlateStyle: Pop+,JLab Go Air Pop True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

311,R3CYQOH4N6KJPO,B09HN594TL,4.0 out of 5 stars Good little ear buds,Minnie The Moo,4,"These are nice little ear buds. Very easy to use and setup, the sound quality is decent. Iâ€™m not terrified about losing them like I was with the more expensive ones. They fit snugly (but not too tight) and I havenâ€™t had any issues with them falling out. The only reason that I didnâ€™t give them 5 stars is because I find them to be a bit difficult to remove from the case. I also donâ€™t love how you charge them. It would be easier for me if you could just plug a cord into the case as opposed to plugging the case directly into the c block as the plug in attached to the case is stiff and difficult to pull out from the case. These are the only issues that I have with these ear buds. In all fairness I also have neuropathy in my hands so this is probably a specific issue for me personally.","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2024",AHPOWAVYU2RIPWGTZHRF4IWDVSLQ,1,0,Color: SlateStyle: Pop,JLab Go Air Pop True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

313,R3C1E4RID4SDBR,B09HN594TL,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Enough,Catherine Green,4,"I'm not good at discerning audio quality, but these earbuds are ever so slightly worse quality than my expensive headphones. But like for the price, that's to be expected. They're good enough for when I don't want to use the bulky headphones.They also don't have a great range. They'll be fine if I walk across the room, but if I start going behind objects or down a hallway, the sound will start to skip a bit. But again, they're fine enough for the price. If you use them with your phone and carry it with you, they'll be fine.I saw someone else say these made their ears itch. Mine itch a bit while using these too, but my ears are sensitive. I only use 1 earbud at a time anyway, so I just switch them out for the other ear when it starts to get itchy after an hour or two. I think that might just be earbuds in general that do that, but I like that I can easily switch them out.I really like that they automatically connect when you remove them from the case, you don't have to turn them on. If they don't detect any paired devices, they automatically enter pairing mode which makes them super easy to use.The magnets in the case are strong and it's a bit hard to take the earbuds out sometimes.For the price, these are great. I hope they last me awhile.Edit: After 2 months, I still like these earbuds. I rarely have to charge them. Occasionally while using them with my TV, the audio starts getting choppy. Putting the earbuds back into the case to disconnect them, then taking them out so they automatically reconnect again seems to fix the problem. Again for the price I think they're adequate for me.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AFK53FA6BDBFPTFOUT66CQ4QLIFQ,1,2,Color: My Little PonyStyle: Pop,JLab Go Air Pop True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

Being an Apple and tech snob I thought there is no way these could be great like all the reviews said. My AirPods quit working after a few years and at the time I wasnâ€™t wanting to shell out hundred or more dollars for new ones. I ordered these to wear around the apartment while I clean and when I exercise at the gym. I got them in the mail very fast. When they came I fell in love with the lavender color so much Iâ€™ve tried to make it my new signature color for everything lol They are beautiful not only in color but also design. I was being kinda bummed about it having an attached USB cord but once I started using them it has become one of my favorite things about them. When I turned them on and added them to my iPhone fairly quickly and they continue to connect without any issues. Super easy. They fit amazing and come with different size ear pieces. The sound quality for the price that I paid is outstanding. They arenâ€™t completely as loud as probably more expensive brands but I can definitely afford new AirPods Proâ€™s but I have remained more than happy with these and they have lasted me for longer than I thought and saved so much money.

Great sound, easily chargeable and Iâ€™ve never had a pair of headphones for this long. I use them with my iPhone 14+ and they work great and the color is cute. One thing I will say is since I use them every day, cleaning them is a must. The speaker screen has fallen off a couple times but I am able to place it back correctly after cleaning and put the ear bud back on. Also the longer you use them the faster you have to recharge them every night, but for the first 6 months I could go days without charging, but again I use them every day so maybe theyâ€™re just getting old.

Next step was to get them out of the case and try them out. That was a bit more difficult then I expectedâ€¦had a tough time getting them out of the case. The buds kept slipping out of my fingers. Didnâ€™t expect that, but eventually got them out. Oh, kudos for the built in usb plug on the case although some people may not appreciate the â€œoldâ€ usb a plug. I didnâ€™t care, so I was happy to just plug the unit into a charger.Now to actually test the buds out. Simple connect to Bluetooth, fired up a music streaming app andâ€¦.then spent a half hour trying to fit the buds in my ear! Eventually had to switch the ear pads to a smaller size, and was ready to go!Listened to a few tunesâ€¦sounded ok, but a bit â€œthinâ€ and a little bright. But I had the next day to really give the buds a listen! Turns out, bad decision. Next morning I started to listen in earnest, various genres of music, at different volume levels. Everything was going great until I got the bright idea of testing out the buds while mowing my lawn! Yeah, bad, really bad moves. Lost one of the earbuds somewhere in my back yard! Spent hours crawling all over the yard with my cellphone trying to â€œconnectâ€ Bluetooth to the missing earbud! Itâ€™s gone, now days later the battery in the earbud has surely died, to be found nevermore!Hence the 3 stars for initially sounding ok but being a pain to fit them in my ear!

401,RUUJJA0TERA67,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,Connor,5,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite. Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros â€“ These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical â€œclickyâ€ buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons â€“ The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldnâ€™t recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didnâ€™t care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter â€œbâ€ in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros â€“ Very comfortable with the same great physically â€œclickyâ€ buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons â€“ Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros â€“ A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons â€“ Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didnâ€™t stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros â€“ Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons â€“ Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldnâ€™t stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros â€“ Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesnâ€™t open accidentally.Cons â€“ This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a â€œflayedâ€ shape rather than the â€œroundedâ€ shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro! While I wouldnâ€™t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine. My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts. The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didnâ€™t realize how desperately I needed.","Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2022",AFEITP6Y25NKH3KB2LXWQCC7STIA,1,2277,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds
402,R3EO2GBST2UICI,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Initial review and comparison to other brands,philip seitz,5,"I love these earbuds. They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the worldâ€” they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.â€”THE SOUNDâ€”Both the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!â€”CONNECTIVITYâ€”These connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly donâ€™t need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.â€”FITâ€”The fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally. (I have small ears, so the fit is review as such)â€”THE CONTROLSâ€”The controls are simple and straightforward. They are just like what you come to expect from earbuds. Single tap, double tap, triple tap.The earbuds HAVE AN ACTUAL BUTTONâ€¦ which I thought was extinct, I personally hate the sensor buttons because adjusting your earbuds in your ears would trigger the controls.While these do have a very sensitive physical buttonâ€” it is easy to avoid while adjusting with practice.â€”BATTERYâ€”The battery lasts me all day, what more do you want?â€”RANGEâ€”Very good, about 30+ feetâ€”CONSâ€”-no MagSafe compatible charging-fit isnâ€™t as perfect as some brands but is really good-if your an audiophile these earbuds are not balancedFinal call-If you like bass, and hate the sensor controls on most earbudsâ€” these very well could be the best earbuds you could get.

I read a previous review from someone saying that the audio sounds really quiet at first and to fix it go into the setting for your headphones and change the press and hold feature to change the volume, after you use the headphones to turn the volume up, you can switch that setting off back to noise control. After i did that the audio was great, nice and loud. The buds fit nice for me with the small ear tips, not uncomfortable. The case is pretty light as well which i personally like a lot. Pretty solid headphones, I quite like them. The noise cancellation doesnâ€™t entirely work, but i dont really mind too much since it still blocks out some noise just not entirely.Solid headphones, worth it :)","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2024",AFRVRGYJJSBAELQK6XVCXXBCJXLA,1,3,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds
404,R29LYUZ7DI2CS6,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Quality sound and build, BUT...",Everest,4,"After using these for a couple weeks straight, I think it's time to review.I would like to state upfront that I bought these on sale for $75. I bought the black ones because the pink ones weren't on sale.Let's start with some pros:The sound is very good, just about on par with my IEMs. These are definitely catered towards more bassy genres, but in the case of metal, I like being able to hear bass along side lead, and provides some heavy kicks. The physical button instead of just touch is an odd choice, but it works. The package comes with a free trial of Apple music (which I will never use), as well as a tiny usb-c to usb-c charger (so hopefully you have a spare usb-c block), and 3 different sized tips, small, meduim, and large. These have awareness mode, as well as a noise isolation mode. Awareness mode is nice, but noise isolation causes me to have a headache.Now some cons:This may be just my ears, but the small tip is too small, and the medium is just big enough to still be pushed out. The body is very smooth, and if you're someone that produces a lot of earwax (like me), it won't stay put and the only thing keeping it in is the tips, meaning you have to keep pushing them back in, and bumping the button. These sit in a very specific position, but don't really like to stay there. Because of the sound mostly being catered towards bass, some leads and vocals can sound a bit muddy at times. By default, the case doesn't have a loop for a string to hold on to and the case is very smooth, so you have to buy a third party case and put it over the stock case just to make it easier to hold on to. These come with an app, and it's very lackluster. No equalizer, there's a find earbuds feature but I'm pretty sure it's not GPS, and you can't mess with settings if the earbuds aren't connected, not to mention: why do my earbuds need to update?!In conclusion: these are good earbuds and I recommend them, but ONLY IF THEY'RE ON SALE.These are 100% worth the $75 I spent on them, but NO WAY ARE THEY WORTH THE $150 RETAIL PRICE TAG.","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2024",AEDBORE5CT34E6D7QVXFZW5ZERCA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

406,R3OTWPP01KM2BY,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars actually disappointing,kimmy,3,"bought these after my airpod pros died on me suddenly. i have been using these beats studio buds for about 6 months and the experience has been inconsistent to say the least. first issue: they fall out of my ears if i do simple things like turn my head or chew. i can barely walk or exercise with them in because they just fall out. i looked online and it seems others have had these issues; people were suggesting swapping the size of the actual ear bud and even wearing them in reverse (with the left bud in the right ear and right bud in left ear). neither if these worked for me. really made me appreciate the airpod design.it was fairly easy to connect the very first time but every time after that is almost always a pain. if the case is dead but the beats themselves are still charged itâ€™s like it doesn't recognize that the beats are still working and refuses to connect. even if the case is charged sometimes it just will not recognize that the beats are in range of my phone, even if they're sitting right on top of each other. if itâ€™s not straight up refusing to connect itâ€™s disconnecting randomly. if i open my car door - even with the car turned off - the beats automatically disconnect from my phone as if it expects me to connect my phone to carplay. there are many times i have been talking on the phone using my beats and suddenly they will disconnect.the controls only kind of work. you can use the default preset controls like pressing twice for skipping songs and once for hanging up calls and the like. however you're supposed to be able to customize these controls to in your phone settings but they only work as long as the beats are disconnected. as soon as you put the beats away and disconnect everything goes back to default settings the next time you reconnect. noise cancellation is a joke, it sounds the same as when its on transparent mode or off.the case feels like cheap plastic. i got a silicone case because i was afraid of scratching it up. not much else to say about it.the color of the beats are great. i got red and it looks super cool. i think the sound quality is on par with my old airpod pros. when i am on the phone others have not had a problem with not hearing me or me coming across muffled, so thatâ€™s a plus.overall, these earbuds are nothing special. i got these around the holidays when they were almost half off. glad i didnâ€™t pay full price for these as they are disappointing at best.ETA: as of july 2024 i ditched these and bought another pair of airpod pros. literally no regrets.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2024",AFSUYJ3N2JAFCBPFF7G6VM5LLT5A,1,65,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

The color is really what I got them for. She loves pink. She has really small ears and the headphone ear plugs that came with these were all too big. We swapped them out a few months later and haven't heard anything about it yet from her. So I'm assuming they are working great. She dropped one into the sink and they were soaked and stopped working for a few days I riced them and blowdried them and they came back to life. Still sound as good as ever.

408,R2MOD3AIAL0RCQ,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good. Not GREAT, but not bad.",Papa Boots,4,"Whenever I see something with a 4-star review, it usually means itâ€™s a solid product but thereâ€™s something (or somethings) keeping it out of 5-star range.For me, these are a perfect example of that. Theyâ€™re small (good), not terribly obtrusive (only some out-of-ear-stick-out, tho your experience may vary), the sound has some solid bass which is helpful for the gym (where I tested these out), the sound overall is clear (download some equalizer apps to play with the sound itself), and they stayed in my ear well. I donâ€™t know much about soundstage or whatever, but the sound itself is clear, bass is nice and strong, and you can hear even the subtle nuances like the shifting of a hand on guitar strings clearly enough without being disturbed. That, to me, is the sign of a good earbud.The transparency mode and noise canceling modes were alright. But thatâ€™s just it, theyâ€™re alright. Granted, the AirPod Pros have a higher price tag, so they do the ANC and Transparency mode much better. So itâ€™s understandable that these would do the same, but on just the slightest bit of a lower level.Iâ€™m also spoiled bc the Airpod Pros have wireless charging. These DO have USB C, but the lack of wireless charging is a small thing, really. Thereâ€™s something about being able to toss these on a charging pad and leaving them there to charge thatâ€™s just so satisfying. Also, was not a fan of how the case just doesnâ€™t have that â€œpremiumâ€ feel. The matte finish is nice, tho I would have liked a little more weight in the case lid, but at this point, these are such little (and I mean LITTLE) things that really, itâ€™s not a dealbreaker.My only thing is the amount they stick out. Iâ€™m sorry, but they do look a littleâ€¦funny, the way they sort of stick out just a bit so that the â€œbâ€ logo is upright. They donâ€™t stick out a LOT, but juuuuust enough that when you look in the mirror, youâ€™ll see a vertical line where the physical button (which I have managed to press on accident a couple of times while adjusting the bud) sticks out. Also, I had a little difficulty getting them to stay in, but thatâ€™s beyond pretty much anyoneâ€™s control.These get that 4th star because of just how they are a solid enough product worth the purchase. They donâ€™t do any one thing particularly well, but there are just enough teeny things for me that I wouldnâ€™t say these are the best Iâ€™ve ever used. (For comparison, the Jabra 75t gets the equivalent of a 4.3 ratingâ€¦the hear-through is amazing and their app really helps boost functionality).For me, these are SOLID gym earbuds. They play music loudly, clearly enough, and the bass is strong enough for me that I can drown out whatever annoying other music is playing outside. They fit and stay relatively well. For the price tag, you get some good bang for the buck. You could do worse, but at this range, depending on if you want to pitch in a few more, you could also do better.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2021",AECTDFXXCI5RLPDMMXH2ELH4LJVA,1,1697,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds
409,R3W44HXR3GUPIE,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Makes sense for price.,Bee,4,"I am not a sound junkie, so take my review as someone who knows nothing about specs, quality, etc.Performance wise, they do what I expect them to do. They play my music. The buds do not have ear detection, so you have to press play/pause anytime something interrupts you. The sound was also very low when I received them, as they were a used product, but a little configuration in my settings fixed that immediately. I had no issues pairing them. I do like that you can see battery level without opening the case, you just go to your bluetooth icon and itâ€™s there for both buds plus case.Theyâ€™re not great at noise cancelling if I had to compare to say, AirPod pros. Theyâ€™re more noise reducing, so if thatâ€™s your driving point with these you will not get what you are looking for. They do utilize spatial audio too, but again itâ€™s just enough to say itâ€™s there.Comfort wise, I like how they fit in my ear. Downside if I am working out they will fall out if I start sweating. They have squishy tips though which I do enjoy.Putting them in the case can be confusing. If you drop the case they will fly out though. Upside to that, these bad boys have survived my washer and dryer three times so far with no hit to the existing quality of sound or performance.Appearance wise they are really small, if you have long hair you could easily hide these during whatever you are doing.I got the black color, pretty standard. Nothing too different than whatâ€™s pictured.Theyâ€™re extremely lightweight too (reference back to dropping the case) so I do suggest a protective case if you need some weight to it.

410,R2FJ02IAUY08JQ,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars Not Worth the Hype: Disappointing Features Despite Good Sound Quality,KFCC,3,"**Review:**I really wanted to like these, but after using them for almost a week, I find them poor in everything except for the relatively good sound when playing music. They are absolutely unusable for my work, which involves video conferencing. This is a deal-breaker.**Pros:**- Sound Quality: The mids are nice and clear, and the bass is tight and punchy when the volume is turned up. When listening to the right kind of music at high volumes, they can sound downright amazing. I appreciate the trueness of the sound, especially given my diverse music tastes from reggae to hip hop, jazz, R&B, and EDM.- Fit: They sit very snug in my ears, effectively blocking out external sounds, which provides a passive noise-canceling effect.**Cons:**- Noise Cancelling and Transparency Modes: Both modes fall short of expectations. Transparency mode, which should let you hear your surroundings, instead adds a hollow reverb and doesn't work well; I couldnâ€™t even hear someone talking directly to me while using it. Noise cancellation mode introduces a persistent noise layer, similar to wind or the sea, rather than effectively blocking external sounds.- Controls: The physical buttons are a matter of personal preference. For me, they are frustrating and cumbersome, often leading to accidental pausing of the music, restarting the track, or skipping to the previous track. I find touch-sensitive controls more intuitive. Maybe I'll get used to it over time, but currently, itâ€™s quite inconvenient.- Bluetooth Range: Disappointingly low with frequent disconnections even at moderate distances. To be honest, they perform similarly to the Earfun Air Pro 3, but I expected them to be better. Maybe I need to cut them some slack since they're a year older (2021) than the Earfun Air Pro 3.- Microphone Quality: Sounds horrible and robotic on a PC, making it unusable for video conferencing or recordings. I need to test the call quality on mobile.**Conclusion:**Overall, I'm not convinced these earbuds live up to the hype or their price. Despite impressive sound quality and numerous positive reviews, I want to be objective and make an informed decision. Here are the questions Iâ€™m considering:- Am I being more critical because of the price?- Is the fact that the normal mode sounds amazing with the passive noise-canceling from the fit enough to overlook the underwhelming or broken modes?- Should I use these earbuds just for music and avoid using them for work, which heavily relies on video conferencing on PC?- Will the microphone performance be better on mobile?- Will the fit remain as good when working out or sweating?- What will happen if they fall into a puddle of water?- Can they handle 8 hours of continuous work without causing fatigue?I realize that I canâ€™t fully trust online reviews, particularly with notable brands where reviewers might be enamoured by the brand itself or the productâ€™s popularity. This can lead to mismatched expectations between what is advertised and what actually meets my needs. Iâ€™ll continue to test these earbuds in various scenarios to make a more informed decision.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AEMRF56YHKNWCKBIVLXZTGEV753A,1,0,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

412,R3QIOBHH01818S,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not excellent for Beats,Amy L.,4,"I bought these renewed so keep that in mind before reading further. Aesthetically, he quality of the product is good, arrived clean, in the original box with charger and manuals. I like the design of the case (small enough to tuck away but big enough to keep track of.) 10/10. The headphones performance though are just ok and that's coming from a long time Beats fan. I bought these specifically because I lost one of my Beats Fit Pro pods (special edition ones that I can't get replaced or don't want to pay 2/3 the cost to do), anyway, these were an affordable backup. Sadly, these particular beats are lacking in sound quality, battery life, and noise cancellation.-Sound quality: 6.5/10 overall for sound with music. The sounds is quite low, volume on the device playing needs to be almost at max to hear comfortably for phone calls or audio/podcasts. Expected more oomph like my other sets.- Battery Life: 6/10. I charged them fully the first night and used them for a 1hr workout and for a few hours of a work shift. The case and headphones were completely dead the next morning without charge. So only one full day of use on a charge which again is starkly different from my Beats Fit Pros that lasted for up to 5-7 days without needing another charge. Boo.Noise Cancellation: 4/10 Probably the most obvious and my least favorite feature of these headphones is the noise cancellation. Even with one headphone in, you can hear absolutely nothing in the surroundings. I know some would love this, but other Beats models have the ambient sound option that allows you to hear the headphone audio AND the surrounding area comfortable. I feel like I'm wearing a hearing aid with these.One perk: Unlike other beats these headphones are interchangeable (at least for me). I was able to swap ears which is nice.Overall Rating: 7/10-Not great, but not terrible.

These Beats Studio Buds were available at another retailer, but not in this red color. I was excited to be able to purchase this red for the same price here at Amazon. Sometimes my little fingers have difficulty pulling the ear bud out of its case, but that may be because of these arthritic fingers. I also question if the battery life is as long as stated. I love the fact that I can connect to music with the press of a button. However, that same button is so sensitive that sometimes I end up disconnecting a caller. The small size of the case allows it to fit inside my jacket pocket, purse pocket, and pencil pouch.

Transparency mode is supposed to make it easier to recognize sounds and voices so that you know when to unplug and listen, but it rarely works out that way with these.Score down on the battery life for the fact that the Transparency mode uses more battery but doesn't work well.That said the ANC works well and the audio quality for music (including Dolby Atmos), phone calls, and spoken word/podcast is superb.

The volume can still be controlled using the buttons on the buds so I'm just really confused about play/pause not working and since I got these for work I need to be able to easily and quickly pause my audio if a client comes in. I contacted support and if the issue can be resolved I'd be happy to update to a higher review.","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2024",AFPOYFUPNAJELC6GJJCDTY7NI4UA,1,3,Color: Sunset PinkStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

I did have to switch the size of silicone part on my earbuds to a smaller size that didnâ€™t come with my set but after that I didnâ€™t have any problems with them falling out. I bought mine in November 2021 and for the last year, I am realizing they donâ€™t stay charged as long as they previously once did. When I first got them they would last all day without needing a charge but now I can barely get to lunch before needing to charge. Thatâ€™s the only disappointing part is that battery life doesnâ€™t last long over time of ownership. Great for listening to music all day long. I canâ€™t hear when people come up to my desk. Very noise canceling. Phone calls can be a little hit or miss where it picks up all the background noise and the caller canâ€™t hear me as well.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AG4XTVMXSBIPFRX7W3F2J3BITGXA,1,1,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

The earpiece hit the oven door, slid down a gap in the bottom and landed near the gas flame. I turned the oven off quickly and dissembled hot oven parts, but as you can in imagine, it took me a little bit. The earpiece came out super hot. I let it cool a bit and tried it and the audio was off, a lot of static.Let them completely cool for a day and they work perfectly. I canâ€™t even tell that I accidentally baked in of them. No difference between the two in terms of operating (charging, connecting, ect)The one downside of the beats is that they seem to have a harder time connecting to my devices, it takes a bit longer than cheaper ear buds.. but the trade off in quality is worth it.","Reviewed in the United States June 25, 2024",AF4WJZO7PR23JVCZITVRRIH4P34A,1,3,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

Once you get it dialed in they do very well, but don't expect it to be a pop and go. The transparency feature was excellent and noise canceling was very close to being excellent. That being said I wouldn't use it at a gun range or standing on the tarmac at an airport. There are better options for that, but mowing the lawn it did a great job of making sure I could only hear the voices in my head, post medication (just kidding).

Here's my review after a week of usage. This Beats ear buds has :> Amazing sound quality (I'm not a music professional; so not sure about the little nuances).> Noise cancellation is really good. I could listen to my stuff, while my family watches TV in the same room. Even with the bud in one ear, the sound filtering and clarity are a lot better than what I expected.> You also get an option to turn on and off the noise cancellation. With the noise cancellation off (i.e., transparency) you can hear outside sounds clearer (not as clear as without the ear buds though).> There are options in the bluetooth settings page (iOS) where the ""press & hold"" function of the ear buds stem can be toggled between ""noise control / Siri"" and turn on ""volume control"".> Battery life is very impressive. For my use case to listen to podcast and music, it lasts for several hours (atleast so far).> When the buds are put in the case, it magnetically latches in the right position.> It fits perfectly in the ear. It has the soft eartips that works better than an airpod pro for me.> It has the ""Find My"" option to locate if misplaced.Just a couple of features that i wish were better if addressed:> Auto audio turn off when the buds are taken off of the ear / falls off the ear. The audio continues in these cases. I.e., if you're listening to a podcast, wants to take it off for a few min and keeps it in your pocket, it can very well turn on accidentally (because it needs only a soft click to turn on) and the podcast would be over by the time you put it back on ðŸ˜†.> No auto-pairing which is a bit annoying. It automatically connects to the last device it was connected. Each time you need to switch to a new device, the connection has to be established manually.> The three clicks for rewind does not usually take in properly, unless you manage to do the three clicks quite fast. If there is a millisecond delay between the presses, it considers it as a single click which is a command to stop.> If you're connecting to the laptop (Mac), the option to use ""noise control / siri"" Vs ""volume control"" seems to be either-or i.e., you may not have both at the same time.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AHWVZ7UB4TNBZUSSELY6RB7RRCUA,1,20,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

The sound quality is very good. I have an iPhone which is supposed to be ideal to use with these Beats but I have ongoing connectivity issues. I have some really cheap ear buds that as soon as I pick up the ear bud, it connects to my phone. These take longer and sometimes simply donâ€™t connect at all. Then I have to put them back in their case and try again. Iâ€™m not sure if it is because my iPhone is an older model, but that shouldnâ€™t matter as far as I know. For an Apple product, their quality falls short. I wouldnâ€™t recommend these. I have had better experiences with Taotronics brand. These Beats were on sale and I thought Iâ€™d treat myself to something more upscale. I wonâ€™t do that again.UPDATE: I recently got a newer iPhone and wanted to edit my original review.

These earbuds are a fantastic blend of style, functionality, and sound quality, making them a strong contender in the crowded market of wireless earbuds.Design and Comfort:The first thing that struck me about the Beats Studio Buds was their sleek and minimalist design. Available in a range of colors, they have a modern look that stands out without being too flashy. The earbuds are incredibly lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit. I wore them for hours without any discomfort, which is a big plus for anyone who uses earbuds extensively throughout the day.Sound Quality:Beats has always been known for its emphasis on bass, and the Studio Buds do not disappoint in this regard. The sound is rich and immersive, with a well-balanced profile that doesn't overly skew towards bass. The mids and highs are crisp and clear, making these earbuds suitable for a wide range of music genres. Whether I was listening to classical, rock, or hip-hop, the audio quality remained consistently impressive.Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:The active noise cancellation (ANC) on the Beats Studio Buds is a standout feature. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience even in noisy environments. The transparency mode is equally impressive, letting in just enough sound to keep you aware of your surroundings without diluting the audio quality of what you're listening to.Battery Life and Connectivity:The battery life of the Beats Studio Buds is solid, offering about 8 hours of listening time and more with the charging case. The earbuds also support fast charging, which is a lifesaver when you need a quick boost. Connectivity-wise, they pair seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, and the connection remains stable even at a distance.Controls and Functionality:The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing for easy management of playback, calls, and ANC modes. I found the controls to be quite user-friendly, with minimal accidental touches.Conclusion:Overall, the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound, effective noise cancellation, and stylish design in their earbuds. They strike a perfect balance between performance and aesthetics, making them suitable for both casual listeners and audiophiles alike. While they may be a bit pricey, the quality you get justifies the investment. Highly recommended for anyone in the market for a premium wireless earbud experience.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AGIAJSPIKY6ECFRXNA6BPVLSNG3A,1,11,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds
458,RGTK8PYYGJ2FG,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Bass I've Heard from Earbuds,Matthew hoffacker,5,"These earbuds pack an incredible punch, I rated the noise canceling a 4 because i notice a slight decrease in audio quality whilst on since the drivers are dedicating some of their power to canceling out whatever noise is playing.The Unboxing Experience: Apple does Apple really well. All of their products have an amazing unboxing experience curated for them. These lil guys are no exception, I even noticed the piece the earphones are attached to is like a inch thick piece of cardboard that feels more akin to metal than cardboard.THEY HAVE BUTTONS: Yes all of the major earbuds have controls on the units themselves but none that I've used have implemented buttons so well. These buds have a physical clicky button on each earbud that clicks with just enough pressure to negate accidental touches but not so much pressure that your shoving an earbud driver down your ear canal. Another instance of these buds implementing what others have better.From an Android user: These pair exactly like any galaxy buds would and or apple products to an iphone. You open the case and if you have bluetooth on it has a cool little animation of your product on the phone and its a one click pairing system. Incredibly easy.Connecting to a laptop: Your case must have a charge or be plugged in for these to pair to a laptop. Theres a button in between the buds that if held for 3 seconds sends the buds into a pairing mode where they function much like any other bluetooth product on the market.BASS: YES IT DOES.Price: I got these whilst they were on lightning deal for 79.99 and at that price they are unbeatable. I've come from multiple pairs of bluetooth earbud solutions such as Quiet comfort buds from bose, samsung galaxy buds orginial and pro and pro 2, and Ive even tried both airpod pros and standard airpods. With having tried all of these I see benefits to having one pair over the other but with that price being a major standout reason these buds are now my favorite option for wireless earbuds.OVERALL: These things are freaking sweet and if you can find them on sale you should most definitely be considering them as your next daily driver. Battery, Bass, android compatability, style points for someone who grew up in the early 2000s (used to love those big over ears hanging around my neck i thought i was so cool) and although i didn't focus much on their noise canceling in my review they do that well enough to switch on as needed. If you're trying to enjoy the sound quality of a song as much as possible i would just suggest getting ear tips that fit well and seal. Even with NC turned off these things seal so well I can barely hear my own thoughts - rather just bass rattling - just the way i like it.9.5/10 Really not much you could do better with them.","Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2023",AE6EQLGONN4MPXYFETOA3GDK7WBA,1,40,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

475,R2J7QWXMNJ99A7,B096SV8SJG,"3.0 out of 5 stars Slippery design, battery and other issues!",Amazon Customer,3,"These Beats earbuds offer decent sound quality, but audiophiles should temper their expectations. While aesthetically appealing, the slippery plastic on both the earbuds and the charging case creates significant usability issues. Removing the earbuds is a slippery frustrating task, and their slick surface makes it difficult to precisely position them for charging. The magnetic charging wells are helpful, but the earbuds often slip and slide between fingers before finding their proper place. A more textured, grippy material would have been a welcome improvement. A slight irritating ticking noise occurs when the earbuds are idle, though thankfully masked by music. Battery life is a major disappointment, falling far short of advertised claims with a mere 3-3.5 hours of use before reaching a critical 15% charge. The noise cancellation is barely noticeable, with only a very subtle audio cue to indicate its activation, which can almost be missed. Additionally, the physical button on the earbuds feels prone to wear and tear and its audible click is distracting and uncomfortable in the ear canal. Overall, I'm underwhelmed by these earbuds and question whether I received a defective pair.","Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2024",AGNI36H7MMREKIH6HPQHV2CGG7BA,1,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds

I was struggling with wired earbuds and a new iPhone 15, which meant having to use an adapter, and I was frustrated by the ones I tried. I thought I would lose mobile earbuds but it's been a month, so far so good.For my primary use, listening to audiobooks, these work great. The sound quality is fine. I've listened to musicâ€”also fine.It comes with a few alternate earbud sizes, but none has been a perfect fit. One side or the other falls out when I lean over, so I have to make sure they're in good. When one falls out, I don't know why, but it's almost impossible to find, even though they're red. I've used FindMy a few times. I have to move the base and the other earbud into another room as far away as possible, and under a pillow, or I can't differentiate the FindMy beeps. But FindMy works great!Last week, while washing dishes, my left earbud popped outâ€”into a bowl of water! I scooped it out immediately, dried it off, and planned to put it in a baggy with silica packets. I was sure I'd killed it. But I am not very patient. I popped it back in after a minute. It worked great!!They have an okay run time but I am often surprised when I hear the signal that means the battery is almost out. On the plus side, when I pop them back in the case for even 15 minutes, they charge fast. At night, I charge the case and within maybe 15â€“30 minutes, it's all charged up, so I can then charge my phone.I'm not sure that the background cancelling works well or that there's much if any difference, according to people I've been on the phone with.

The quality is alright but could be better. My biggest disappointment was how they arenâ€™t too compatible with Siri. Iâ€™m a delivery driver so I canâ€™t always pull out my phone to unlock it and reply to texts. I came from air pods and air pods will read you texts as they come and let you reply WITHOUT unlocking your phone. These beats DO NOT do that, they wonâ€™t read texts and if you ask if you have new messages it will require you to unlock your phone. Also the Siri voice sounds a little muffled and it doesnâ€™t always pick up what you say when you do use voice to text. Thatâ€™s the most disappointing thing about these, I thought since they were bought out by Apple years ago they would imply the same software but no.Overall theyâ€™re decent, nothing to out of the ordinary.The noise canceling is nice. They also come with different sized rubber attachments so you can swap them out if they donâ€™t fit right.Another thing I might add is that theyâ€™re a little bulky. The first few days of using them my ears would be sore just from wearing them. Again on sale theyâ€™re worth it ($80) but at full price ($150) I wouldâ€™ve been much more disappointed.Overall the sound quality is crisp but I personally feel like it could use a little more bass, these tend to be louder with the quality of voice over the quality of the music.That being said the battery life is okay, itâ€™s nice that the case charges them. Thereâ€™s also no way to see the battery levels of the case unless you have an iPhone and open the case near it.

Another positive is the controls on the earbuds work relatively well compared to many others. The problem comes in the fact that the sound will pop in and out intermittently while you are exercising or walking. The biggest problem I had and the reason for the low rating is that they will come unpaired sometimes if you pull an earbud out of your ear and they will not re-pair on your phone by turning Bluetooth on or off or anything else. The only way to get them to re-pair is to put them back in their charge box and pull them back out again. That doesnâ€™t do any good when their charging box is hours away and youâ€™re out exercising. The last time that happened to me, I took the earbuds out and threw them in the woods as far as I could throw them. I have a couple sets of wireless earbuds that donâ€™t sound as well, but I would much rather have them as they are reliable.

They have multidevice pairing and single earbud use, which were the main things I was looking for.Comfort: The stock plugs were kind of painful, but luckily this came with both larger and smaller plugs. The smaller set fit great in my ears, without ever falling out. I can wear them for about 2 hours and feel comfortable the whole time.Battery: Battery life is very, very good. I don't know the upper limit because I've never hit it. So far both the buds and the charging case hold charge very well.Audio: The audio on these is solid. Not mind-blowing, I've certainly heard better, but solid. Like a 7.5 or 8 out of 10. I am not an audiophile so this is more than ""good enough"" for me to use for music and phone calls. If you are an audiophile who needs the perfect crystal sound, you should probably look elsewhere.Form factor: They feel and look good in my ears, though like some reviews say, they are a little slippery. The round small shape and texture make it easy to drop them while putting them in or out. Likewise, the case can close easily, just as you balance to put buds away. Just be careful when doing so.Pairing: These were very easy to pair, and they pair and turn on INSTANTLY when you remove one or both from the case. It's mildly longer to switch if you have them paired to 2 devices, but that's kind of expected.App: The app that comes with these is really barebones and serves no purpose after initial setup. Just use it to set up your preferences, then you'll never need it again.Noise cancellation: I thought this was a gimmick, but it's actually very helpful. You can cycle between full noise cancellation, none, and pass-through. Personally I found pass-through to be unnecessary, with just on and off for NC to be enough. The Noise Cancellation can't cancel out EVERYTHING, but I used it during yard work and it cut the sound of a leafblower down by at least 65%. So it won't block everything, but definitely helps a lot in noisy environments. Similarly at the gym I felt with NC on, I really only heard the music and my own breathing, very little distracting other sounds. Do not use this while driving or crossing streets... it wouldn't be safe.Overall, for the price these are MUCH better than I hoped. Have to be one of the best purchases I've made in a while.","Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2023",AG474R4F2TZG4EDS3Z5WNBFJZYYQ,1,21,Style: Elite 4Color: Dark Grey,Jabra Elite 4 True Wireless Earbuds

They also stay in place without being too tight for my ear.As for appearance, I like the sleek little case they charge in. It fits perfectly in my traveling case for my tablet. The case itself does close easily, so be careful when putting the ear buds in or taking them out.Performance has yet to really be tested, though I plan on taking them when I fly to Australia.They were simple to connect to my iphone 14, took me playing with my tablet to get them connected.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2024",AHJIATGSMP4WSALSKWX7WXNTI5ZQ,1,3,Style: Elite 4Color: Dark Grey,Jabra Elite 4 True Wireless Earbuds
503,R2BSSFJZCHB4L0,B0BTZKP1TP,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent sound quality. Not as comfortable as I'd like.,Cold Weather Dweller,4,"I bought these as a temporary replacement because I thought I had lost my Jabra Elite 7 actives (which in turn had replaced Jabra Elite 65t that stopped holding a charge.) I just wanted a cheaper pair while I decided about getting the new Jabra 10s.The sound quality on these is as good as the Elite 7s but there is a definite difference in comfort. These are bulkier and heavier in my ear and they don't stay in as well as the other pairs.I mostly listen to podcasts and pop music, so the fact that these are low bass is plus. I generally don't use ANC, but let's face it, no one buys Jabras if ANC is a priority.It usees the same Jabra app as the other headphones. That app is a huge selling point for Jabras in general. I love being able to change the sound profile and the white noise feature has gotten me through many an hour in a shared office.So, sound quality and Jabra app is worth the $50 I paid, but I couldn't wear them more than a couple of hours. I was happy I found my Elite 7s. (I had put them in a weird drawer for some reason.)If you're looking for bargain earphones, there are cheaper ones than these and if you're looking for more comfort, you should go up a price tier if you can.","Reviewed in the United States October 27, 2023",AGF4VBEXEQQJZHW4JUT7SIMW4E4Q,1,6,Style: Elite 4Color: Dark Grey,Jabra Elite 4 True Wireless Earbuds

591,R2L1ANZVDHD204,B0BTZKP1TP,"4.0 out of 5 stars very comfortable, has most of the features found in more expensive earbuds",Win,4,"Jabra may not be considered a top brand for tws like Sony or Bose. They weren't known for highest audio quality like Technics or Sennheiser. However, when it comes to comfort, Jabra is second to none. I bought this pair because it's cheap and very comfortable.The Elite 4 has almost everything I was looking for even though it's not the best in any of those categories. First, it feels very comfortable the same way my Elite 7 does. Second, it has ANC and imo, better than the Elite 7. I haven't had a chance to try Elite 10 to compare yet so hopefully the 10 would do better but then again, it's 3 times the price of the 4 so I can't complain. ANC has never been a strong point for Jabra's products anyway but at least it still cut down some noise when I'm in the open.Hearthrough, however, is the best compare to all the other tws that I tried over the years. I remember Jabra was one of the first company came out with the idea to use microphones to allow users to hear the surrounding. My ancient 65t has this feature and that was so many years ago. I think this is one of the best quality in Jabra's tws and this pair still live up to that. Unfortunately, I can't control the level of hearthrough like my other Jabras so that's a bummer but at least it has that feature.The Elite 4 can be used either left or right by itself. What I like about it is it supports a real mono mode. Believe it or not, I have a few, more expensive, high end brands that doesn't support a true mono. When you use the right, you don't get the sound from left channel and vise versa. The Elite 4 combines both left and right so it's perfect for use as a mono.Multipoint is another feature I've seen in Jabra tws since 65t. This one has it too while, again, many expensive pairs don't support it. I have 2 phones so this is a deal breaker for me and Elite 4 delivered.Now, let's talk about some cons. First, this pair is slow to connect. Compare to other tws that will connect instantly after I took them out of the case. The Elite 4 took at least 2-3 seconds. Annoying, yes but I'm use to it now.Another thing I don't like is I can't change anything on the app the way I did with my other Jabras. Can't even customize the control. Luckily, at least they allow you to adjust the eq.So, my conclusion is if you're looking a working pair of tws that has all the features found in top brands. The Elite 4 has about 80% of it without breaking the bank. Just don't expect some fancy things like high res, top tier ANC or million ways of customization. The pair still work really well enough to be a daily driver. It has good microphones even though there're only 4 rather than 6 but I've never get a complain. Very compact and super comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States April 13, 2024",AGOA6VPNL3A4APRLVEK2AV2RZ6HQ,0,0,Style: Elite 4Color: Dark Grey,Jabra Elite 4 True Wireless Earbuds

600,R3BTKZXBVLBBUE,B0BTZKP1TP,4.0 out of 5 stars Work well.,Ivan Perez,4,"These headphones work really well. Iâ€™m going to compare the to the 1st Gen AirPods as thatâ€™s what I have to show what I like and donâ€™t like.First off, you need to download the app to pair to your device. Annoying but whatever. After you make the settings to your liking you donâ€™t have to use it again, the headphones just pair.What I like about them is that each side has a button that has its own dedicated functions depending on how many times or how long you press it. And you feel the click feedback. You can adjust the volume which you cannot do with the AirPods I have.The headphones also have very nice Noise Canceling in them. You can set it for sound to Passthrough but even then itâ€™s low and muffled compared to the AirPods. I use my headphones at work and because I drive for a living I so NOT like the noise canceling since I need to hear around me driving in busy NYC. Even with the sound passthrough itâ€™s not enough. I have to take them out. Thatâ€™s most likely because of the silicon tips that the regular AirPods donâ€™t have.Speaking of, Iâ€™m not a fan of the tips. But thatâ€™s just a personal presence. Thatâ€™s one thing I love about the AirPods. They donâ€™t have tips, and they are comfy and do not fall out most importantly.One thing about the AirPods is the mics LOVE to just stop working. Iâ€™ll be outside with them in and still holding the phone to my face because the caller canâ€™t hear me. Mad annoying with no clear solution for it. Iâ€™ve tried them all it doesnâ€™t work. They work when they damn well please. I didnâ€™t have this issue with this set. tThey worked every time. Granted not enough time has passed to see if they stop functioning like the AirPod ones but so far so good. You can hear clearly and you can be heard clearly.They work like any other BT headphones. The case charges them. You charge the case with a USB-C cable. I donâ€™t think it has wireless charging but thatâ€™s fine. The battery life Iâ€™m not even sure what it is. I was never concerned for it. Or had them die. To be fair I donâ€™t leave em in as long as AirPods because as I stated earlier I need to hear and I feel like they impede that for me so I remove them.I do recommend these for people who use public transportation which is why I gave them to my fiancÃ©. The noise canceling works great. If you donâ€™t need to listen to your surroundings, I recommend these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2023",AHLSHNLUSQX2V4FNBKAK3DIWXIFA,0,2,Style: Elite 4Color: Dark Grey,Jabra Elite 4 True Wireless Earbuds
601,R1JBQTP05FUBYC,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for the price,DocBrown,5,"Iâ€™ve been reluctant to go wireless, mostly because of sound quality issues of Bluetooth. But I really like the idea of being free from wires while at work, I already have phone/meeting headsets that are Bluetooth and love them. These went on sale Cyber Monday for a good price so I thought Iâ€™d try them.I found them a little bit of a pain to setup. The â€œQuick setup guideâ€ was lacking information. Once I downloaded the full manual I figured out what I was missing and then got them setup and working with my phone. Sound is very clear and bass is excellent and not muddy. It does take a little tweaking of the EQ in the Smart Control app. Noise cancellation is very good considering its passive. These are generally comfortable but can cause a little fatigue if in for long periods. Iâ€™m in and out of meetings everyday so generally this is not a problem for me. I have found that I cannot position them the same in each ear. Everyoneâ€™s ears are different but unfortunately the only way to know is to try them. Battery life is good, though I stick them in the case when I leave my desk and the charge tops off on its own. Being Bluetooth, they do drain my phone a lot more than wired buds. I canâ€™t comment on failed bub issues yet, itâ€™s too early, so weâ€™ll see.I didnâ€™t intend for these to be used with phone calls but ended up taking a few calls while wearing them. I was surprised at how good the voice sounded. Warm and no distortion. The person I was talking to said it was pretty good. She had no trouble hearing me.A few complaints in the reviews I noticed of which have fairly simple solutions.1) Lack of bass. Make sure you are using the correct size ear adaptor and that it is snug in your ear. This is critical. They have the medium on out of the box. They seemed fine, but after a couple of days I took a chance and tried the large. Wow, dramatically better. I also found you have to wiggle it just a little to get the maximum effect. Also download the Smart Control app to get a bit more bass from the EQ. I suggest trying the Sound Check component of the app.2) For the units that are prematurely dying, I wonder if the contacts are dirty. The full manual specifies they do need to be cleaned from time to time. Also, they do have a 2 year warranty but you have to contact a Sennheiser partner.EDIT: I mentioned above that I got a little fatigued with them in for a while. After pulling out a couple of hunks of ear wax with the right ear bud, I decided to try some ear wax remover. Not only do the bud fit better, they are more comfortable. Something to think about if you are experiencing discomfort.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2022",AFWLU4KB7AN2ZGSOS3HICOKC44SQ,1,26,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,
602,R1YXPTOD9CWT3I,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound at a good price,Ben W.,5,"I recently lost my AirPods on a trip and was looking for something to replace them. I didnâ€™t want to pay what they wanted for the AirPod pros and I wasnâ€™t really impressed with the sound quality of the AirPods, so I went looking for the best sounding sub 130$ wireless earbuds I could find. I settled on the CXs and received them today. Iâ€™ll get to the sound quality at the end but first let me go over some other aspects. The set up was extremely simple, there are clear directions, I just pulled them out of the box removed the very obvious and labeled plastic covers on the battery contacts and then charged the earbuds for about an hour. Once they were charged they paired with my iPhone no problem I also downloaded the app which worked without issue. The fit is slightly less comfortable then the AirPods however they are not uncomfortable and feel quite secure. These buds lack ANC however I donâ€™t think that will be an issue as they are very effective at blocking outside noise. The touch controls are intuitive and work smoothly. So far I have used them both together and one at a time and have taken them in and out of the case and have no issue with connectivity, you do have to reconnect to the app if you disconnect from Bluetooth however the app does have to be running for the earbuds to work, only if you want to run the equalizer also reconnecting to the app is very simple. The only â€œissueâ€ I have had so far is when I updated the firmware; everything went fine however be prepared to have your phone and earbuds tied up for about 40 minutes while the firmware updates; during this process the app needs to stay open and the earbuds need to be close to the phone. Itâ€™s a little nerve racking because I was worried if for some reason the update was interrupted it could brick the earbuds, that being said it went fine just took a long time(the app does give a fairly accurate countdown so that helps a little). So how do they sound? There is no doubt these are the best sounding pair of earbuds I have personally heard in my life. Iâ€™ve owned the AirPods, the Jabra 65t, first generation beats, and a couple different Chinese pairs; none of those are even in the same category. These where the first earbuds Iâ€™ve had that do not sound like music is just being pumped into my ear canals; the music sounds like itâ€™s naturally coming from the surroundings. Every instrument and vocal track are clear and separate. The bass and treble sound great and balanced and if you really like pronounced bass you can turn it up in the equalizer and it thumps. Itâ€™s really hard for me to overstate how awesome the sound is, I listened to a few songs that are now in lossless Dolby atmos on Apple Music and itâ€™s nothing short of incredible. The best metaphor I can think of is all of my old earbuds were like Standard definition and these are 4K. So if your looking for the best sound for your money and probably the best sound for under 200$ these are the way to go.","Reviewed in the United States August 5, 2021",AE7GOV7WYUWHSSVCGB5SQSMJI34Q,1,76,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,
603,R19VWKTRIXU414,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Solid choice for ear buds,Crotorious,4,"I've used these ear buds for almost 2 years and strongly considered re-buying them once I started facing issues. When it comes to sound quality, they're good, and the latency is small, but you'll notice it's there. The best part of these ear buds has to be the battery life; these things last all day, and can be fully charged back up twice with the case. Though if you're looking for something with strong noise cancellation, you might want to consider looking for a different pair of ear buds, as these are really only capable of blocking out most speech. Overall, they're a pretty good pair of ear buds, but I do have a few problems with them.First, when they get to low battery, the text to speech voice will say ""Recharge headset"" just frequently enough to become mildly vexing. This is my primary complaint about these ear buds.Now mind you, I haven't treated these ear buds very well, they went through constant abuse and were used in sub-optimal environments the entire time I've owned them. The next two complaints are likely a result of my poor treatment of these.Second, after about two years of use, their connectivity isn't as great anymore; the range in which I can use these has dropped considerably. I used to be able to walk in my backyard without issues, but now I can barely leave the room without the connection dropping constantly.Lastly, the left earbud has recently developed a problem with connecting to the case; it seems the leads just don't connect half the time. This occasionally causes small inconveniences with the left ear bud turning on in the case and randomly hijacking the audio output of my pc, or it just doesn't end up charging and I'm stuck with a single ear bud until I manage to get it to charge again.Overall, this is a pretty good product. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a pair of long-lasting wireless earbuds and doesn't need the best sound quality or noise cancellation.","Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2023",AFRT3UTZANKCA7EGGKYQAVIXOJ5Q,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,
604,RB0NQXL4O1IZ,B08ZR5JB9G,1.0 out of 5 stars Only really lasted 8 months,Jake Boop,1,"Edit: originally rated 1 star as the earbuds that I received were open-box/used. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s fair to Sennheiser that my 1 star rating remains on here because that was a fault of Amazon. These earbuds sound great. Absolutely great. The connection seems to be good so far as well (Iâ€™ve seen a lot of negative reviews saying otherwise). They are very comfortable for my ears, Iâ€™m a Tool Maker/machinist and wear an earbud in one ear I all day and other earbuds that Iâ€™ve tried get uncomfortable or start to fall out but I have had no issues with fit at all. As far as the features on the app: the equalization is only a 3-band eq which is a shame, Iâ€™d much rather at least a 5 or 7-band eq but itâ€™s better than nothing for sure. The side tone feature is supposed to use the mic to feed into the speaker, allowing you to hear outside talking, but it doesnâ€™t seem to really work at all. I havenâ€™t tested a phone call using them yet so maybe my mic is defective but I really wouldnâ€™t care because I donâ€™t need it. Overall this is a great pair of earbuds for the price.Original review: This item came in with the packaging already opened with another piece of tape over the original seal. The earbuds were covered in earwax and ear hair. Disgusting. If I wanted to buy an â€œopen box/usedâ€ I wouldâ€™ve selected that option instead of paying full price for it.Edit 3/14/2023: it's been 8 months and the connectivity issues have been becoming a decent problem. I take them out of the case and they won't connect, so I put them back it and take them out again and usually they'll connect after the second try. But lately I've been having to re-pair them to my phone. I'll take them out of the case and instead of the usual ""power on..... connected"" notification, it's just silence. And it's not as simple as just re-pairing them because they won't go into pairing mode unless I reset them. The battery life is also taking a dive.I started out really loving these, now I've been very disappointed because they're just such a hassle to deal with. With all of this, especially only being 8 months of use, I'm going to have to update my review from 5 stars to 2.Edit 7/17/2023: the right earbud just stopped working all together, it'll power on but refuses to connect to BluetoothEdit 1/24/2024: I've been trying to get as much use out of these just to justify the amount I spent on them before I replace them but all it has really given me is issues with connectivity and reliability. I expect any earbuds at this price range to last years, I should have no problem getting the same life out of earbuds that you would expect from a phone. I wish I would've just either returned them or thrown them away a long time ago. I'm going to start looking into replacements now.

605,R32H19VXW9WGNF,B08ZR5JB9G,5.0 out of 5 stars Comparison with Momentum TW,Steve Kranyec,5,"I have a pair of CX's that are about 1.5 years old, and another set that I just recently purchased. In the middle, I have a pair of Momentum TW 3's that are ~6 months old. The TLDR here is that instead of repurchasing the Momentum, I got another pair of the CX's.I'm not an audiophile, and I mostly listen to audiobooks and make calls with earbuds, so I'm not going to be speaking to audio quality at all. For me, it's fine.My six month old Momentum's have a dead left earbud. Possibly this is anecdotal, but if anything I was more gentle with the Momentum's than the CX's, and the CX's have lasted three times as long. Yes, I drop them. Yes, the dead left Momentum died after the most recent drop. I'm not saying that earbuds should survive infinite drops, but in my experience, the CX's are more durable.I did really really like the ANC on the Momentum's. It killed the battery life, but when you need ANC, it was great to have. The pass-through audio was also awesome. It was almost like having a mini-hearing-aide.The CX's have been substantially less finicky than the Momentum. They connect quicker, I've had to reset them fewer times, and they seem to have better range.Between the (substantial) difference in price and the areas where the CX's are superior, I my opinion, the CX's are the better option. If dropping $150 every six months on earbuds is within your budget, I fully endorse the Momentums. For me, I need to have two working sets around at any given time as I wear them a substantial amount of my waking hours, so I'd rather swap to an overear model when I need ANC and go with the cheaper and more durable option.Quick recommendation -- splurge on the foam eartips. If you're like me and wear earbuds an unhealthy amount of time, they're substantially more comfortable. They do wear out, and they're not cheap, but the added comfort for long-wears is huge.","Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2023",AGW3GZDQI7IIZB7FOD2IAOKUKMGA,1,8,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,

A perfect example of the sound is with FFDP ""A little bit off"" which has extremely clean sound on a quality system.

During phone calls the mic is good in a quiet place. if there is ANY background noise, they will pick up that noise over your voice. I tried them multiple times in different cars and no matter the amount of road noise it drowned out my voice making conversations almost impossible unless I yelled. In an office environment the sound of the keyboard while typing would make conversation hard to understand for whoever was sorry enough to be on the other end of the call.I've been a Sennheiser fan for a long time and have had many of their headphones (still use some old wired buds CX100II for listening to music at work and love them), these are the first that I am returning due to be unusable for conversation.","Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2024",AHYASE5EWU5VJUIBY7QPUY6JS6FA,1,0,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,
607,R1DTEWZS5AYFKH,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars Not quite what I expected,Michal D. Wisteria,2,"So I'll start with the positive. The headphones are comfortable, the sound is great, and the battery life is pretty good too (supposed to be 9.5 hours, I got around 7). The bass felt great, skipping songs was a breeze, and the sound quality when answering calls on them was decent as well.The less great parts. After 6 1/2 hours or so, one headphone would die, usually the left one. Then the right would reconnect, and I could keep listening to things for a bit longer. But the biggest reason for the 2 star review is that my right earbud broke after about 11 months. I took good care of these headphones; they were usually in their case or in my ear. Last week I noticed the right earbud had no sound. I thought I just had to restart them and reconnect, but after a few tries of that I heard just hints of sound for half a second when moving the earbud in the ear, so I knew the audio wasn't working. But all the other features were. I could still pause, skip songs, etc with the right or left earbud. I went on my order page on Amazon and found the support section. There was a link to a product support site for Sannheiser... It was 404, page not found. There was a phone number too.... It was disconnected apparently.

I prefer over-ear headphones, but needed something small, portable and more discreet for work.These looked decent and my past experiences with Sennheiser sound quality also helped make my decision at the time.Sound quality is excellent, overall noise isolation is pretty good for no ANC, bass mids and highs are all present and clear. I do own several pairs of studio/reference headphones, which these obviously don't compare to, but they do manage to make a good account of themselves. Battery lifespan is excellent too and despite no wireless charging (not that it was a deal breaker in my case) the case charged very quickly. Just would have been nice if the charging cable was longer than the dinky one supplied.I used the smallest set of ear cushions, these are decently comfortable for up to a couple hours but do start to press against my ears for longer periods.Construction quality of the case and buds is decent, not too heavy but not feather light either. It's a shame that doesn't go into the internal electronics.First off, the Bluetooth connectivity is not a win. These would repeatedly disconnect themselves when bringing them out of ""sleep"" always one or the other bud. The Sennheiser Smart Control App does allow customization of the buds controls and a graphic equalizer. But it would keep proclaiming it needed a update, even though it was the most up-to-date version.Now these, when they paired, sounded great. After using these for nearly a year, the right bud suddenly had an internal fault and produced flakey, weak sound. That was not a Bluetooth issue, but rather the hardware either failing on a circuit level or a wire becoming loose due to a cold solder joint. I've owned plenty of headphones that are more cheaply made than these with worse sound quality but still function as intended.Looking up this problem seems to be inherit with the CX True Wireless, with complaints occuring anywhere from a few months of ownership to nearly a year or more. Replacements from Sennheiser have been described as having a repeat issue after a similar period of time, or are merely DOA.Shame, this isn't the Sennheiser I knew. Time for a different pair from a different manufacturer.

Furthermore, I opted for a higher price point than the rock bottom price I was hoping for.I forgo noise cancelling since I don't need it most of the time. Sonically, this pair of earbuds is very good, bearing typical Sennheiser sound of open and balance. It is still no match for my over the ear headphones, but it is also significantly cheaper. Sound quality is by far the most important aspect, other features are distant seconds and thirds.BT connectivity is, however, not Sennheiser's strength. It took some work to get it connected to all of my devices; I have a pair of Sennheiser over the ear BT headphone that behaves similarly. All of my cheaper BT earbuds have no BT connectivity issues. This weakness is not a showstopper.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2023",AES7SSQNH3WNT4EAPENHZ67TRHBQ,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,
612,RBEOQ98PJ3836,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser knows headphones,Baron,4,"I had some Klipsch ear pods I had to return. Sure they had the metal case and metallic earbuds and all those sizes earbud tips but internal quality was bad a constant buzzing sound from a bad chip so I ordered a second pair still bad so returned both of them. I started think what headphones do I she that just simply worked no gimmicks no flash just pure bonafide Hi-Fi then j realized Sennheiser of course. When I bought these they had just come out no Amazon reviews but I took the chance cause I love my HD-25s and I havenâ€™t looked back. Iâ€™m an engineer a job that requires focus by my office is smack dab in the middle of a factory floor full of loud noise forklifts , bulldozers firing up for test, people grinding metal , all of that on top of the normal office chatter and these headphones cut right through that while I work at my desk and get work done.Now yes these are 100% plastic but they donâ€™t feel cheap and that plastic also means they donâ€™t feel cold touching your skinYes they use standard ear bud tips which I was apprehensive about cause Iâ€™ve had issue with those falling off or coming off in my ear but these are designed with an aggressive ridge to keep the tips attached to the headphone.No wireless charging but who cares itâ€™s USB-C just plug it in at night and go about your day they last all my work dayAnd the sound is probably as good as it gets from reasonably priced Bluetooth earbuds so yeah no bass boomy but thatâ€™s inherent in the form factor bass requires big drivers and lots of power which kills your battery life and adds weight.Could you get better sound sure but why itâ€™s Bluetooth off your phone into tiny battery powered earbuds so your quality is limited already so this is probably that sweet spot where diminishing marginal returns kicks in where you have to spend way more money or buy big Bluetooth headphones to get better soundIf you buy these as earbuds for work or travel where portability and battery life trumps fidelity then youâ€™ll love these if you expect fidelity similar to much pricier wired headphones youâ€™ll be disappointed but only because your expectations were unrealistic.0","Reviewed in the United States November 16, 2021",AFV7ZI225WCIGLKBRRZGPKITFUKQ,1,9,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,
613,R167YMGKLUDYU2,B08ZR5JB9G,4.0 out of 5 stars Comprehensive rating: Sennheiser puts sound first (as usual),Scott Herron,4,"After years of using cheap-o headphones and dealing with cable noise, listening to music with the headphones feels like i'm hearing each song for the very first time. I'm hearing details in songs I never heard before, it honestly made me tear up. Incredibly clarity, customizable EQ, AMAZING sound for 100$. You could easily get something with comparable sound that costs twice as much. The sound is why I bought these. Sennheiser is a sound-focused brand. However, there are some places where these headphones cut corners that would not be a problem if you bought 200$+ dollar headphones.Security: I'm a dancer, and I want my headphones to stay on while I'm working in the studio. However, the earbuds aren't the most secure in my ears. They fly out during chainÃ©e turns, sometimes even just as I'm walking they'll fall out.Comfort: Not the most comfortable for hours of listening. After 2-3 hours of extended use, my ears ached. Changing up the plastic tips didn't help.Noise cancelling: I heard the ANC takes the edge off the sound quality, which is why I bought these and not the active noise cancelling ones. You can definitely tell. I can hear each step I take as I walk thudding in my ears. It's a little odd.Delay: I've tried to use these to watch tiktoks on my phone, and I've noticed a delay in the screen and the sound. I can see the person on my screen moving their mouth, but the words come out into my headphones a little later. It's not the worst, but it's noticeable.Overall: Great for audiophiles on a budget. The app allows you to customize, so there's something to love for everyone, whether you love a sparkling, bright treble or you're a total basshead. For sitting down and listening while you're at your computer, these are an excellent choice. If you're mainly wearing these for working out, maybe something else would suit your needs better. I do equal parts both, which is why I like these a lot. mp3 files can massacre the music quality, and bad headphones can make the sound even muddier. These are an excellent buy. I've had them for about a month, will update if something changes or I have issues.","Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2022",AEMZ3AH6ZAOKKCAPU6IMERPH7HRQ,1,5,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,

Having owned multiple headphones/earphones over the years this is product is in-line with Sennheiser â€“ great sound quality for the price (they lowered it), but you pay with electronics/wiring issues. This maybe the last Sennheiser product I get for a while, but not in a good wayâ€¦Goal: Portable â€œdo everythingâ€ earphones with good sound quality. I wanted to be able use them around the home: smartphone music, binging Netflix, work computer for Zoom calls, etc. Iâ€™d been using whatever generic thing $40 could get; this time I decided to splurge past $100 (purchased at was $130 w/ points).Pros:â€¢ Sound quality. Iâ€™m not an audiophile, but Iâ€™ve owned 10+ headphones/earphones, different brands. The sound is lively, bass is strong without being overwhelming.â€¢ Case â€“ form factor is great! Fits in my pocket, doesnâ€™t looks scuffed after many months of use.â€¢ Battery life â€“ lasts for many hours before needing a charge. Could probably use it 2-3 days of regular use before getting a warning.â€¢ Mic works â€“ gets the job done.â€¢ Sennheiser app â€“ you can change what device it connects to and adjust EQ settings.Cons:â€¢ Connectivity: atrocious. Iâ€™ve had to soft reset / hard reset this too many times. Bluetooth isnâ€™t a new technology. This should be â€œset it and forget it.â€ * About 5% of the time, only 1 earphone connects. Disconnecting and reconnecting doesnâ€™t do anything and I have to do a soft reset. * When using the app, it sometimes refuses to disconnect from the current device so I can connect to what the device I want. Real fun 3 minutes before your Zoom meeting! * Sometimes doesnâ€™t â€œrememberâ€ how to connect to specific device(s). Iâ€™ve had to delete all pairings and reestablish connections twice so far in 9 months.â€¢ App: clunky. Randomly asks to update the firmware â€“ no, Sennheiser! When I open this app, 99% of the time I want to switch devices! Do it right the first time!â€¢ Features: this thing lacks soooo many features that exist on $40 earphones today. For this product not to have things like wireless charging, noise cancellation, connecting to multiple devices, the only thing I can think of is a paywall (greed: wanting to upsell a more expensive product).","Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2022",AHKUJNCDT5O4CZ4IGDK2UBM7KLYQ,1,15,Color: WhiteSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,

616,R1HOIBXMUJ3YZ4,B08ZR5JB9G,"3.0 out of 5 stars Sound is good, shape is awkward",Jennifer C.,3,"These earbuds have a really good sound. And I love that there is an equalizer in the app so you can adjust it to sound the way you want it. They offer a lot of cool features that apparently not all earbuds have. You can change what the different taps do, but they are capable of answering your phone, raising and lowering the volume, fast forwarding, rewinding, or skipping tracks of songs, pausing and playing - all just buy tapping on the earbuds. Even though it is not one of their advertised features, they also do a very good job of noise canceling as long as they fit in your ear properly.So here's the downside that I found... These earbuds are large and square. Most ears are pretty round. I realize that all ears are shaped differently, but I have a hard time believing that these fit comfortably in most ears. If you're just sitting still at your desk or in the car, it's not too bad. But if you smile really big, they come loose, and If you lean over, they fall out of your ear entirely. When the Stem is seated properly in your ear, The big square part rubs uncomfortably against the outer ear. For this reason alone I am debating whether to return these, or Just suffer with it since I mostly use them in the car or at work. These could be great earbuds if they were more organomically designed.One last note - I don't have a lot to compare it to. But they advertise that the battery life is superior on these, and i'm not convinced. Now I admit I had them running for most of an 8 hour workday. But I had to switch between the left ear and the right ear while one of them was charging in the case, i'd use the other one. So from my experience, I could not run both of them for 6 or 8 hours continuously.","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2023",AEGNAFTHCFQMCNABBLNIN3IRRHEA,1,4,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,

I have had pretty shoddy luck with headphones, but I had heard good things about this brand, so I thought Iâ€™d give them a go. Their sound is overall above average from what Iâ€™ve listened to. Theyâ€™re not super bassy like the Beats and Raycons Iâ€™ve had, which in some ways are better. I think a lot of peopleâ€™s problems with these is that they arenâ€™t proper Audiophile material like some of Sennheiserâ€™s other products, but if youâ€™re looking for wireless buds, you probably arenâ€™t really looking for the greatest sound on the market.I like the software that these use. The app lets you tweak the bass, mids and highs a bit so you can get get the sound a bit more to your liking. It also lets you switch between sources more easily than some other Bluetooth headphones.I will say that these arenâ€™t the most ergonomic earbuds ever, they fit just fine normally, but if you try to sleep with them, or put any pressure on your ear with a hat or something, they really dig into your ears, but thatâ€™s a non issue to most people.The noise cancellation is decent, but Iâ€™m pretty sure thereâ€™s not any tech behind it like with the AirPods, I think these just plug up your ears so you donâ€™t hear the outside noise, and they do that pretty well.The case is pretty good too. Itâ€™s a bit thicker than the AirPods case, but itâ€™s not as huge as some others, feels high quality, and holds a charge very well.","Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2022",AGRH7XGXKLIEPMBBM2ACI6JYH3DA,1,9,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,

620,R2DX8KHP8703FK,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars This one doesn't live up to the Sennheiser name,Nicky,2,"I had a Sennheiser full over-the-ear headphones some years ago and was satisfied with it. I bought this one on Black Friday and have been using it for several days. I now have three pairs of earbuds: Apple AirPods, SkullCandy and this one, which took me the most time to pair and connect.1) The small paper guide conveniently didn't mention that a small film on the mental contact must be peeled off. The charging case showed green light after a couple hours charging but I couldn't get them to connect. It was only after researching the questions section that I learned about this step (so apparently others were confused too).2) The shape of the earbuds make it difficult to grab and pull them out of the charging case. Each time it takes more than one try.3) No indicator light on the front of earbuds themselves to show the battery level. My SkullCandy (much cheaper but equally good sound quality) has indicator light on the earbuds. It would become red to tell me to put it back in the charging case.4) To connect to a device for the first time is confusing. A YouTube clip tells me to watch the little light in the back to blink red/blue to indicate it's ready to pair/connect. But when I tried to connect with a second device (after disconnecting from the first one), it didn't blink. The guide shows to put fingers on the earbuds (after inserting into the ears) to put it in paring mode. The SkullCandy doesn't require any additional step: after the earbuds are taken out of the case, a voice tells you that it's ready to connect.5) It won't let you switch from one device to another easily. When I turn off the Bluetooth on my iPad and tried to switch to my cellphone (with earbuds still in my ears), I can't connect right away. I wound up having to put them back in the case and then take them out to connect to the second device (unlike SkullCandy, which stays in pairing mode and lets you connect to the 2nd device right away).All in all, It's not worth the value compared to a cheaper but better product like SkullCandy.Added 12/27/2022: Now that Iâ€™ve used for more than three weeks (bought on Black Friday), I should downgrade the rating from my initial 3 stars to 2 stars. I finally managed to connect it with my laptop after several attempts but it seemed random and I still donâ€™t know how it happened. And it happened several times that one of the earbuds would lose sound for no apparent reason while I was using them. I would need to take them out of my ears, put them back into the case, took them out to reconnect again. Or sometimes only one earbud got connected with the device after taking both out of the charging case. I would not buy it again.","Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2022",AGUCYTK4WI5QN4KWJ7K43QZ6LSKQ,1,5,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,

I use these for content consumption at home so don't need all options available like sport buds, remote charging, outdoor or loud environment noise cancelling, etc. Those features cost extra money so I got a great price on these for exactly what my needs are. When they were brand new on the market they cost a lot more. A lot of news channel interviews are with guests not in the studio. They're at their home or office so the sound is of poor quality. I listen to a lot of news in Spanish so with the other factors mentioned it's hard for me to understand. Sometimes there will even be a music overlay which really makes it hard for me to understand.

Connection problem.Eventually most earbuds will start disconnecting from my phone, ToZo, ILuv, Senheiserner, ect ect...These earbuds are no exception.Now for the first two weeks these earbuds were perfect, they had great sound, great connectivity, the app worked without issue.But after week two, they started not connecting to my phone, sometimes they would cut out randomly, and I had to restart them. For cheap earbuds, this is expected. Not for $100 pair. However I had bought so many, I was tired of it and gave these the benefit of the doubt.Here I am a month and a half later and the issue alas only gotten worse. I don't know if it's Senheiserners fault, or the particular pair I got, but either way I couldn't put up with it any longer, thankfully Amazon offered me a full refund, and I intend on buying the ""Google Pixel Buds A-Series"" (the ones I was originally going to get)I really wanted these earbuds to work, and I took perfect care of them. I didn't let them over charge, I never dropped them or tossed them once. So I know for a fact that fault wasn't mine own atleast.If you want good earbuds of a similar price, I dunno, this is the most expensive pair I've owned.If you want good earbuds of a cheaper price try the Mpow M30 Plus, I've had that pair for almost two years and they have failed me only twice in all that time (and it was my fault). Or maybe I genuinely just got a bad pair, I don't know. I know when these earbuds worked, they were excellent.I have had great experiences with Senheiser in the past, this is the first time they've let me down.Hopefully this is the last negative Earbud review I ever have to make, we'll see Goggle Pixel Buds A-Series, I'm coming for you next, don't fail me too.","Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2022",AFHOTNY7QTDBDCLJRYRG2OVX3S4Q,1,2,Color: WhiteSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,

Personally I think these are more comfortable than the Galaxy buds and the sound quality is superior to the Galaxy buds. That might not be the case for everyone. The Sennheiser CX is a bit bulky, so angling and fit I could see not working out for everyone. They are snug for me and generally a great fit, however I have had an instance of it falling off once or twice.

Was looking for something equally as good but for a bit cheaper. Stumbled across these and looked at some reviews. Flossy Carter's review is what gave me the go ahead, but boy was he wrong on this one.These are extremely cheaply made (case and earbuds feel horrible to the touch), the earbuds are uncomfortable to wear for more than 30 minutes, the sounds quality is nothing as you'd expect from Sennheiser. And the horrid app is nearly unusable.Normally I'd excuse the sound quality when you can set your own equalizer, but the app to do that doesn't work half the time. When you launch it, it just flat out doesn't connect to the earbuds. It will show them for a second but then say connection failed. If you get pass this, the app is extremely slow and buggy. Even if the app worked, the equalizer only includes bass, mids, and highs so you can't fully customize it to your liking.For some good points about these earbuds. They are lightweight and don't move around easily in your ear. The magnets to secure the earbuds and close the case feel great. The touch controls are very responsive. The sound queues and tones are clear and easy to understand. And the battery life is good + it charges quickly.So give these earbuds a pass and go with the JBL Live 300's. Much better sound quality, and an app that works. They are $150 retail but frequently go on sale for $100 (I got them for $75 on amazon). You'll also be getting auto play/pause, and a slightly better water resistance rating at IPX5.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2021",AFL7DAIS7RHT23VDIZF4BZKBABWQ,1,44,Color: WhiteSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,

I think most of us do, at least anyone looking into something like Sennheiser.That being said, I usually go to Bose, because they have fantastic sound, and, they are the most comfortable for me. The wingtips really help keep them in my ears, and since they're soft silicone, it's comfortable.I typically don't like in ears with this design. They annoy my ears to the point that I just can't wear them for more than an hour. These on the other hand are actually quite comfortable. They aren't the most comfortable thing on the planet, but I find myself able to wear them for hours at a time without feeling any fatigue.The noise canceling does leave a little to be desired, but it's definitely present. It doesn't suck the world out like a nice pair of over ears or a really, really nice sent of ANC in ears. But, for the price point, they weren't so far away from things double, or even almost triple the price. They're great.The best thing about these earbuds, though, is their sound quality. They sound absolutely fantastic. Now, if you're a basshead, they probably aren't quite for you. But if you want to hear the nice boomy bass, punchy kids, and sparkly highs; these are fantastic. You can hear the low end a bit better with the bass boost profile, you can even EQ them in app to your preferences. But for me, the take home with these was the solid sound signature. I could hear all of the lower undertones of sound work in the high end, while getting a nice clear sounding low end. Again, if you're really looking for that low end - low kids punch, these probably won't do it for you. But if you want all aspects of your song to stand out equally, these are great.At this price, if you're thinking about getting them. I say go for it.

I tested it with different types of music (rock, hip-hop, spanish, etc), as well as some podcasts. While the sound quality across the board is good, it didn't outperform a $50 pair of Enacfire E90 earbuds I had before they stopped working. When it comes to bass, the old E90's actually did BETTER than these. The comfort is decent, and aren't heavy enough to fall off your ears. Unfortunately, I can't say anything about the battery life since these STOPPED working less than 24 hours after they were delivered!Oh and about the failure, I mainly blame their (stupid) ""Smart Control"" app for this. Like I said before, the earbuds worked fine and paired quicky...until I used this dumpster fire of an app. At first, I was able to link the earbuds with the app and then I tried to update the firmware since it was available. Big, BIG MISTAKE. Even though the earbuds were (supposedly) at 90% battery and were recently charged with a fully charged case, I was instructed to put them them back into the case in order to start the update. After doing so and waiting an hour, the earbuds have refused to go into Bluetooth pairing mode.***UPDATE 08/22/2021***After contacting Sennheiser support via email, they suggested that I get a replacement pair, which is what I did. After getting them, I have to say, I now LOVE these earbuds! I don't know why, but this pair sounds a LOT better than the first ones I got. I can now safely say thay sound better than anything else I've tried, including my old E90's. Pairing was simple and fast, using a single earbud was effortless, and the range is fantastic.While I didn't get the 9 hrs of battery life that was advertised, the most I've gotten so far is about 7.5 hrs, which is still great for true wireless earbuds. Regardless of what you listen to, these earbuds sound amazing and have a great amount of bass. While a few have said that these are too heavy for their ears, it wasn't the case for me. I work in a warehouse where I'm constantly on the move, and I NEVER experienced a moment where I felt like these were going to fall off. That being said, I stand by my previous comment where I say that these won't fall off your ears, even if you're moving around. These are rated as IPX4 water resistant, which I'm going to say is legit since the warehouse does get hot and as a result, I do get pretty sweaty.***UPDATE #2, 09/10/2021***I once again find myself HATING these earbuds! After working perfectly for a few weeks, the left earbud of the REPLACEMENT (2nd) pair I got stopped working. Just like the 1st pair, I tried multiple resets, both soft and factory, and I get no audio from left side whatsoever. I also checked my devices' settings and can confirm that they work perfectly and are not the issue. At this point, I probably won't bother contacting support again and will just get rid of them. $130 in the trash thanks to Sennheiser!","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2021",AGCJFB7PLYJWNNGPHSOJ4A2LKAEA,1,57,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,

To my ears they sounded overly bass-heavy and I prefer a flat EQ. They also had all kinds of connection issues with my phone (an iPhone, no less). So I decided to try these Sennheisers out as a replacement, and I'm really glad I did. The clarity and overall sound quality is leaps and bounds better than the Airpods. And the battery life is far superior as well. I take long walks every day with these, and only need to charge them maybe once every other week? Phenomenal.My only two gripes would be 1. the size of the case, which is somewhat bulky when shoved into a jeans pocket, and 2. the rubber tips that are included. Although they do provide 3 sizes (small, medium, large), I found all sizes of the Sennheiser tips to be too shallow for my ear canal, causing the buds to fall out rather easily. However, I replaced the tips with some slightly deeper ones (from an old pair of $30 sony's), and now they fit perfectly with no issue.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2022",AFZ7QT7BY5SUCXWO6MDQELMKKC3A,1,1,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,

They have superb sound quality, but there were a lot of issues I had with them. They were large with annoying battery leakage and fast battery depletion. I bought these in April when I started a new job because I would be taking a train regularly. I wanted something affordable but didn't want to sacrifice the sound quality that I was enjoying before, with a much better battery quality. These really haven't disappointed. They're not quite as good sound as the MOMENTUMS, but they are still very good for $70. I reckon most other brands you'd have to be spending at least $150 for this quality of sound. The battery life is incredible on them and they're my daily use when I'm commuting. The touch controls are great, much more intuitive than the MOMENTUMs. Their size is a massive improvement over the first MOMENTUMS, they do not stress my ears nearly as bad. Couldn't have been happier with this purchase. Sennheiser is the only audio company I purchase from, and they have rarely missed for me. At this price range, it's an automatic recommendation if anyone ever asks.

The (8 HOUR MAX) battery life is valid for only one of the earbuds, the other dies in half the time causing the other to also start spewing its ""Battery Low"" message until you set it back to charge. They say 27 hour only because you get about 3 Charges from the case, which is also Sad. The material they're made of (including the case) provides ZERO grip so you'll most likely have them simply slipping out of your grasp AND your ears. They refuse to stay in even during something as simple as a light walk, you'll find yourself constantly having to push them back in place. As for the connection, it's Horrid. As many other reviews state, sometimes one bud doesn't connect and you have to factory reset them about three times in a row to fix the issue. The Range is hot garbage. Doesn't even extend down a 12 ft. hallway. My 7+ year old Skullcandy Hesh headphones have a longer range. A joke to be sure.

She and I compared them the other day to a pair of very high end buds given her by the record company as a gift. The ones she had were at least four times the cost of these Sennheiser but neither she nor I could hear much difference.

This means that when they are on your ears or in your ears, you feel like the sound is outside of your ears instead of right in your eardrum. This creates a soundstage with more depth and clarity. These are not the headphones to bump your trap music to. These are headphones to enjoy great acoustic music, classical music, jazz, watch movies, and enjoy some rock music. With rock music, it should be understood that you will get a nice open sound, but that you will not be getting the blistering loudness that comes with other headphones, especially wired headphones. In some ways this is a better things, especially in regards to your long term ear health.I am 2 days into enjoying them, so I will update if the charging and individual earbud dying issue comes up.

App that was suggested also helped to make the experience better and things went pretty smooth once I was able to figure out the equalizer. There is a sign up option to get a more user experience friendly equalizer which is great but it doesn't take that long to sign up and get into it. You can use one at a time as well and they have a long distance before they start to break up in signal. The bass is great and it isn't over the top. The feel of them and weight of them is perfect so no issues. It even latches into your ears pretty well so I had no issue at the gym with them.

I use them every day and too many times have one earbuds connection been much weaker and the volume is drastically lower than the other (happens with both ear buds) and turning them off and on again and returning them to the case isn't enough and I'll have to repair my earbuds. I've had to do this every few weeks, sometimes even a few times in a week and pairing them has proven to be much more difficult than it should be. Often it said the earbuds couldn't be paired even though they were turned on and full battery. Another thing, my left earbud will die almost an hour before my right one does, and I make sure to clean them well so they charge.My left earbud also has the most connection issues as recently I'll hardly tap it or move my head and the earbud will lose connectivity and buffer a lot. I never listen to my earbuds with more than half volume as I don't need it because the sound quality is pretty good, but that means I know my speaker isn't blowing out and there's just issues with the manufacturing of this product. I never had these issues with my galaxy earbuds, and am quite frustrated. Other than these issues, they have good quality and potential. Hopefully it's just my earbuds that are like this and not the product as a whole.","Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2022",AHNMLAD5TCX67UDZIRG34YCIUXYA,1,2,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,
664,R2TFFHXODEW9TJ,B08ZR5JB9G,2.0 out of 5 stars Problems With Connection,Hydromantes,2,"I recommend that you do not buy Sennheiser earbuds. Like all manufacturers, they will change the name of this model if they have not already done so to deflect their products from bad reviews so I can't trust anything they make.I've used these for over a month now and they keep disconnecting. I use them for several hours every day and this happens three or four times each week. If there is no audio for a few minutes, they disconnect but they will re-connect with a single click which is a minor inconvenience. However, they also just stop working randomly and will not re-connect at all. That could be a problem connecting with Bluetooth, but often one earbud will continue working when the other earbud is dead and must be re-charged. That proves that it is not a Bluetooth problem but a problem with the earbuds. Even after recharging, the dead earbud will not always re-connect easily. Frequently I need to remove them from my Bluetooth list then re-pair them which is a major inconvenience. I used to have a pair of wireless Sennheiser headphones that also would not stay connected. It seems Sennheiser doesn't know how to make something that will connect to Apple devices, which is too bad because they sound great and I like the controls.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2023",AG26TQWV757VVM7CQB7OTPND3ESA,1,0,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,

This wouldnâ€™t be that much of an issue if the included equalizer was capable of addressing those frequencies, but the 3-band, non-parametric EQ is not capable of doing this.

Everyone has different hearing, individual preferences and varying levels of ability to detect (or even care about) audio fidelity. First impression out of the box: Well-made and beautifully packaged. It took me far too long to figure out why they weren't charging; turns out there was plastic film over the terminals, which I don't believe the documentation mentioned. (The documentation is pretty lame, btw...) Once over that hump, as soon as I got them connected to Bluetooth and to the app, it asked for a firmware update; this took an incredibly long time. First impression of the sound: crisp, clear, not quite loud enough (for me), but the low end is sorely lacking. Treble perhaps too bright. The EQ inside the app is pretty clever and helped improve the sound, but I was still hoping for more...ooomph...presence...<insert other audiophile words>. (For reference, I was listening to Spotify Premium (highest quality) over Bluetooth.) Phone call performance is excellent. Fairly comfortable/good fit.

The main issue is that sometimes one or both headphones will stop working or desync from my phone for no reason and with no solution. I have gone months (Multiple times) with only one headphone working while the other one blinks red and green like a Christmas tree only to fix itself randomly months later. Again, this has happened several times with both headphones. Sometimes for days, sometimes for months.

Not bad... But you won't be catching any fine detail in your music. Definitely not worth the asking price.Just don't buy these.

Because I have had two pairs of these earbuds and they have had nothing but problems. With both pairs they wouldnâ€™t charge and if I was able to get them charged then they would connect to my phone. And trying to rest the earbuds requires both earbuds to be charged and in the charging case. But thatâ€™s just the problem thatâ€™s my issue they wonâ€™t charge so some days I was just wasnâ€™t able to use them at all. Overall very disappointing experience. But like i first said these can be really great earbuds but for some reason Amazon just gets them from a place that just doesnâ€™t have them working properly. If youâ€™re thinking about get these just consider buying them elsewhere.

I don't know why I felt the need to have wireless earbuds, but I bought them. The sound quality is super super good, and I don't know if the fact I have an Android is useful to anyone. The sound is deep, and super loud, and I can't hear anything above my music. I will be test driving them on an airplane to hear how well the noise cancellation works. I have only tried one size of the tips, so maybe they are a tiny bit uncomfortable because I have the wrong size. I will try other sizes soon. I think Sennheiser makes the best earbuds, and headphones, and so far I am super happy with this purchase.","Reviewed in the United States April 20, 2022",AGF57QYQ2GJ5O6EREJQBK4WTVUYA,1,2,Color: BlackSize: SmallStyle: True wireless earphone,

I love green so a matcha color was perfect but there are very bug issues with it. 1st big issue is the charging, the buds dont always snap in to the case and connect with the magnetic prongs that charge them leading to me having to push them down (not hard but still) in order to make their they charge and often check on them. This also doesn't help thay their aren't really any indication lights other than 1 one the Case so unless you plug it up you really ain't got a way of knowing if the case is charged or not. Issue 2 the pairing & connecting, the right bud when pulled out with reconnect most of the time but sometimes needs me to manually select them in the Bluetooth menu while the left bud needs to be manually paired each and every time I use it just about, it's as if the bud is able to have a reconnecting memory unlike other skull candy products. 3 issue, this one is very minor but the hinge on the case is just to low you need to hold the cas a very special way or on a table to open or your finger will hold the cases lid shut which is just bad design and I honestly don't know how that made it pass concepts. 4th issue another small one but the Cases lid just opens way to easily when dropped as there's no magnet or just clip helping hold it shut like other brands or even skullcandys just literally sitting ontop of the cases lower part. For 24.99 I expected a product I wouldn't have to fight to use, and for a skullcandy product I expected quality but yet clearly there isn't a lot here in the products functionality. The sound is good as all skullcandys are but thr issues weight that down by a lot.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2024",AEDH4UKBU4S74FUGFWEUEFX2IOOA,1,1,Color: Matcha,Skullcandy Smokin' Buds In-Ear Wireless Earbud
708,R2HZ1PX4BEMFYR,B0C2F5KD26,"4.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable, love the color, long lasting charge",MJ,4,"I have been a Skullcandy fan for years. My previous buds the â€œIndy Evoâ€ lasted almost 3.5 years. Excellent for midrange $. Hence I immediately returned to the brand for my next bud. I decided to try a different bud now we are in 2024 and the technology has evolved a bit more. Budget matters now more then ever in this economy. After looking at multiple reviews and several different new options they have out, I really was liking these for the look, fit and $. After having them home now and using them for about a week, here is my humble opinion. Pros: LONG battery life. I mean I think I charged it once overnight after it came home and put it on the charger again to check the status and it was still green. It is pleasing in appearance and definitely travels well in a pocket or purse. It has that little charge cord you see in my pictures. The c end goes to the case and usb to your computer, laptop or usb cube. I like the light indicator which tells you how charged the case is. The box comes with three different sized tips to ensure a good fit. The actual bud sits pretty comfortably because of the design. I have small ears and they donâ€™t hurt after 4+hrs of wear. Decent connectivity. I can leave my phone on the table and walk into an ajoining room. It depends on if there is to much between the phone and signal. If I go out to the yard to lock up the chickens and leave my phone in the house, thatâ€™s about 30â€™, I loose connection, but it automatically re-connects when in range. Cons: volume on these puppies with one bud and max volume on my phone is low, I mean like I am struggling to hear. I do have some very mild hearing loss, but I mean I am talking volume on max and it sounds like itâ€™s on low. I didnâ€™t have this issue with the Indy Evo. The next and bigger issue is loose fit. Although ergonomically shaped for the ear, they are not secure for me. If I am just sitting working on something and listing or walking around listening not to bad, but as I continue to move my head around you can feel them coming loose. Over time they feel insecure. I constantly fiddle with them to re-secure them in place. I used to take daily walks at lunch with my Indy Evo, not sure I would feel safe doing that with these. I wouldnâ€™t want to lose a bud or drop it in the dirt. I might try sizing down to the small tips even though medium feels comfortable, just to see if this somehow gives a better secure fit? I miss the little fins on Indy Evo. They pretty much guaranteed those little suckers went nowhere. Overall I think I got what I paid for. In this day and age of technology and insane $$ this is a decent tech, good looking, excellent charge, easy carry and easy on the wallet. If I want something for they gym or what have you I would probably invest a little more money so I get something I donâ€™t have to worry about possibly losing.

Extremely impressed with this product. The buds charge so fast in the little box, it's absurd. Been jamming out for the past 3 hours and still at 90 percent. Only complaint is you have no way to skip the track forward and back without using the assistant. Love the switchable equalizer built in. Pairs very well with my Motorola which comes with Dolby Atmos. Bluetooth connectivity works excellent. I can walk into another room in the house, door closed, without my phone and it won't even skip a beat. There are different tones that play in the headphone each time you press the skulls on the sides, so you can count your clicks, which I thought was pretty cool.

My first were a pair of wired Smokin Buds I found in a parking lot. I was shocked at well they sound, so I ordered a few pair off ebay. I used these mostly cardio on treadmills. Sound quality was excellent with a nice bass. The fit always seemed to need adjusting.A few years ago I tried the sport bluetooth version of Smokin Buds that go around the neck. these had same qualities of the wired version.Now for these wireless Smokin Buds II. I have paired them to 5 different devices: Motorola, Samsung Apple iPhones and an iMac. Sound and fit are excellent. There are 3 built in eq settings: standard, movie and music, that can be changed easily by tapping 4 times on the Skull icon on either earbud. As for the sound the bass seemed deeper on the wired version but not by much.There are small medium and large ear adapters. I believe I am using the smallest ones.There is a charging cradle. You can charge the cradle even when you are wearing the earbuds. When you put the earbuds away the cradle will transfer power to the earbuds without them needing to be plugged in.USB-C charging port with a short USB-A to USB-C cable.Fit: I have shaken my head and the earbuds didn't move. The fit is snug.I have not tried them with exercise yet.Pairing: touch one of the Skull icons for 3 sec. and you will hear ""ready for pairing""For $25 dollars these are excellent, Enjoy!","Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2024",AE6XURB2XGIU6KP2TRKMTMEW7NMA,1,20,Color: Matcha,Skullcandy Smokin' Buds In-Ear Wireless Earbud

Any time I walked away to wash my hands, literally six steps away from where I put my phone down it would act up immediately. The battery icon shown could be better too. Itâ€™ll show me that I have a mostly full battery and then shut off. Itâ€™s warned me before with a voice message, but it is not consistent. Aside from that it is great at noise cancelling, but the earbuds donâ€™t fit my ears as well as they could have; might be a fault on my part if you can choose the size.

801,R2B13J5B42HCX8,B0BYPFNW6T,5.0 out of 5 stars First Impressions,Whyborg,5,"Long time fan of Sony products. Have the WH-1000XM4, WF-1000XM4, and other brands. Just got these this morning and listening now. Pretty happy with sound quality, the Sony app helps as I like a punchy bass and have typical high frequency loss for male adults. Once set up with the app, clear bass turned up almost to max and treble up Iâ€™m enjoying the sound. Sounds very much like the WF-1000XM4. Noise cancellation seems similar but need to do more listening in different conditions. Got the XM4 reconditioned and unfortunately the right battery is failing to hold a charge after about a year and a half so got these to satisfy my earbud itch until the XM5 is released. Actually liking the push button as opposed to the touch controls of XM4. Not better, but not worse. A bit smaller which Iâ€™m pleased with as I like to sleep with audiobooks on. I can sleep on my side with a soft pillow and not feel very much pressure. Did have them pause as I have the right side on default to pause and skip but only once so far so I donâ€™t think it will be a problem. Contrary to some reviews either side can he configured to volume with the app. I have volume on the left now. Single press notches up, holding lowers volume. Default is to switch between noise cancellation or ambient mode. I have cancellation on most of the time so volume is more important to me. Also saw criticism about them not automatically pausing when removing, not a problem to me as I can easily pause touching the right side button. I also have some QCY buds that were surprisingly good for the price, and Soundcore A40 witch were also a good find, paid $99 but now $79. Theyâ€™re almost as comfortable as these for bed but protrude a bit further so when sleeping on my side more pressure on my ear than the Sony. So far noise cancellation on the Sony is the best, almost as good as the XM4.For the price, I think this is a very good alternative to the XM4. Battery life is rated to 7.5 hours and the Soundcore are rated to about the same but by early morning I get a rudely loud charging notification. Weâ€™ll see how the Sony last with similar use and update this review later. Overall in direct comparison of the XM4 Iâ€™d say these are just about as good but maybe not as broad of a soundstage. If you like Sony or are just looking for a good quality earbud with noise cancellation at a reasonable price these would be a good selection. One major improvement for me is the tips for the buds. I have large ear canals and the memory tips on the XM4 were a huge disappointment, they would not seal in my ears which is terrible for sound quality and noise. I keep all the tips from many earbuds over the years and even with other brands need to dip into them to find larger tips to seal in my ears. Pleasantly surprised the included large tips actually fit me. I included a photo of the Soundcore, QCY, XM4, and the WF-C700N for comparison. The WF-C700N seems to be the most comfortable so far. Slightly smaller than the Soundcore and definitely smaller then the XM4.So after using these about a month Iâ€™m still happy with them. I do have the occasional problem when listening to audiobooks in bed with the buttons for pause or volume getting just a little too much pressure and activating. Fortunately for volume one notch is louder but if you hold it the volume is reduced so at least I havenâ€™t been blasted by max volume. Much as I like Sony products the other buds I mentioned would probably suit most people fine with a lower cost. But theyâ€™re not Sony! Still anxiously waiting for the soon to be released WF-1000XM5. Hoping for the lighter weight than the XM4 and the comfort of these with touch controls instead of push buttons. But for a mid-price bud these are still my favorites.Another update, these are not working for me to sleep with. My left ear gets a little raw spot on the edge of some cartilage. Iâ€™m primarily using the Sony WF-1000XM5 )got them 2 weeks ago) and the Soundcore A40 for audiobooks in bed. The headphones until my ears get too hot and the A40â€™s when I want to lay on my side.The Sony has some edge or something on it that makes a tiny little sore spot on the cartilage in my ear. Still like them a lot but now using them when I do my indoor cycling. I have a couple big blower fans on me and the Sony blocks out a lot of the noise and are better then the QCY Iâ€™d been using. Theyâ€™re more rounded and I get less wind noise also.WF-1000XM5 just released, expecting mine Friday. I REALLY hope they donâ€™t irritate my ear the way these do.So Iâ€™d still recommend these. Itâ€™s probably just my personal ear shape causing me an issue, no problem on the right side but nobody is perfectly symmetricalâ€¦8/523Update. Got the XM5 2 weeks ago and loving them. Fantastic sound, lighter than the XM4, better bass, more comfortable. But again the tips donâ€™t fit. Airtight seal is critical on noise cancelling earbuds. The app is the same for The 700â€™s and XM5 but the 700â€™s do not have the feature enabled that checks for a seal. I discovered the left bud on the 700â€™s and the new XM5 just wonâ€™t quit seal. I found a hack to make the tips moldable. If you get Sugro glue (kind of like clay) roll a bit up, pull up the mushroom part of the ear tip, take the rolled up piece of Sugro and wrap it around the fitting to the bud, roll the tip back down and now you have a moldable tip. Insert in your ears and make sure they a good seal. You may have to reshape it a bit with your fingers if you work it too much. Once you have a good seal let it set a few hours and now you have a fitted tip. Works with my big ear holesâ€¦I have to reiterate, the 700â€™s have a very pleasing sound once you get the equalizer and clear bass setting adjusted to your taste. I just finished using them for 4 hours straight on loud during a 2 hour indoor cycling session, walking the dog, and making my lunch. Enjoying music I havenâ€™t listened to for too long. They were comfortable (almost forget theyâ€™re in) sound excellent, and just put them away with 50% battery left.I really think most people would like these and would not be disappointed in any way, especially at the price. The XM5 are better, but to most people probably not $200 better (but I love them too!).9/22/23 a note about the app and the codecs used. I feel like a dummy now that I finally noticed right at the top in the headphone connect app it tells me on my iPhone itâ€™s definitely using the AAC codec and shows if DSEE is on or not. DSEE definitely improves the sound. Compared the noise cancellation against the WF-1000XM5 and the XM5 do a better job with the 2 blower fans I have on me during my indoor cycling. But I still prefer using the C700n just because I want to be very careful with the more expensive buds.10/23/23Lost these! Looked all around but canâ€™t locate. I was able to replace them @ $88 so not hugely upset, ordered a new pair and happy all over again. One of the reasons I really like these is how light they are. Even after 4-5 hours of wear I almost forget theyâ€™re in. Still one of my favorite pairs.Revisiting noise cancellation, walking my dog with light traffic only a few feet away Iâ€™ve had the chance with the new pair (left button default is now toggle ANC transparency off or on. With it off Iâ€™m not hearing much of anything but my music. In transparency mode I can hear everything around me. Iâ€™d give these a 9 from 1-10. About as good as any ANC buds Iâ€™ve tried.12/22/23Found the lost pair so now I have 2 pairs of the WF-C700n and not unhappy about it. These are definitely my go to buds, use them more than the XM5â€™s as theyâ€™re so light and comfortable and now at $76 I donâ€™t worry as much about loss or damage as with the pricy XM5.

802,R11HJEV7XJYDDM,B0BYPFNW6T,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for running and comfortable,Rick,5,"I typically run anywhere from 20min to 1 hour several times per week. I also sweat very heavily. To the point where clothes and towels are soaked.After trying half a dozen ear buds... The Sony c700n is the only one that stayed in my ear the whole time without falling. And they did so comfortably. The fit, comfort and grip is just phenomenal. It's almost as if Sony designed these for my ears. The default ear tips they came with the buds miraculously worked and I didn't even have to try the others.Some of the grip and stability is probably due to the weight of the buds as they are very light and sit very well in your ear.Flagship models are obviously fine but they have a huge disadvantage to runners since they are a lot bigger and heavier and therefore lose some grip and stability.The sound quality on the C700s is excellent as compared to my Galaxy Buds Pro 2. Honestly I can't tell the difference in quality. Even without the advanced codecs.ANC is probably where I see a difference compared to my Galaxy Buds. The Samsung ones are better but not by leaps and bounds. Id call the Sony c700 adequate and works sufficiently well at the gym to block most noise. With music on you won't hear any outside noise.Phone calls is an are where these struggled for me. I can hear other people just fine and clear... The issue is other people cannot hear me... Complaints I often hear is that I sound very far away and the noise cancelling for some reason does not work well during calls. Calls I made in moderately loud places were a near disaster. If you're in a quiet environment maybe they will work better. Hopefully they can fix this with a software update.I can't fault these buds though... I got them for sports/running and good audio quality... And for my use cases I am blown away! Especially at the price point.I prefer the push button interface rather than touch sensitive while running. This is because sometimes I need to adjust the buds without activating any commands. Touch sensitive earbuds are annoying for this matter. Sony designed the buttons well and they are easy to operate. It goes without saying that I can adjust the earbuds without accidentally activating any commands.The case could not be better for gym and sports. It is small, light and minimalist. Love the texture and they are small enough to keep in my pocket without noticing. Given the price point of the buds, I also wont mind if they get scratched of dented. The design is very practical and the ""rough"" plastic texture looks very nice to me.The app is very simple and works well. Besides software updates you can also adjust EQ to your liking. The app is very minimalist but gets the job done. I haven't explored the additional app features yet mostly because I don't think I have a use case for them.Buy these for the gym, very good audio quality and adequate but not stellar ANC. Do not buy these for personal or work phone calls.For the price, it is hard to believe the value these buds offer.","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2023",AGUBP7OHOLRD4H67LLYJZLHRWHFQ,1,92,Color: Black,Sony WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling in-Ear

805,R2D95JSE3TO700,B0BYPFNW6T,1.0 out of 5 stars Will not enter pairing mode. Ever. Horrible instructions.,Verskate,1,"Update: Feb 2024 After having these for about 6 months, I figured out the pairing issue. It's hard to explain but it is done using the Sony Headphones app and disabling the option for connecting to more than 1 device at a time.New issue - charging. Actually not new, but every now ant then the earbuds just won't charge. You place them in the container, the light turn on and glows green, then shuts off. All the while 1 or both earbuds will be just about empty on battery life. So you have to play the game of removing them from the case, placing them back in the case, over and over. That doesn't work all the time either, so then you need to plug them into a power source and remove/place in the case until you get a solid orange light that doesn't disappear in 2 seconds. It's a pain in the a$$. Especially when you know the case has a full charge and you want to use the earbuds only to find out 1 or both are dead. Huge let down from Sony. Calling their support line, maybe I can get a different pair. These suck.Maybe I just got a bad set, but these are the absolute most difficult earbuds that I've ever owned. I've factory reset them at least 5 times and have wasted a good 2 hours of my life trying to pair 2 different devices. The instructions to pair a second device are to place the earbuds in the case, leave the lid open, hold the button on the back for 5 seconds. Sounds easy right? Nope. It's not. The buds will not enter pairing mode. Ever. I can connect to the first device, but good luck with the second. One thing I did learn when I was able to get two devices to pair, that one time, was to be sure to disconnect the earbuds from the first device. Besides the over-complicated method of entering pairing mode, I've had the earbuds only connect one bud, on a few occasions. So you'll get 1 bud to connect, and the other is dead. Trying to get them both to turn on was another clunky nightmare and I ended up just factory resetting them. I'm done messing with them, and they're going back to hell where they came from.UPDATE - If you're using the ""Headphone"" app on an Android and want to connect to ""pair"" with a second device. DO NOT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON SONY'S WEBSITE. They will only mess up your earbuds and make you frustrated. In the app under ""status"" locate the ""Connected Device(s)"" and tap that. The next screen you'll see a + button on the bottom right. Click that! That will put the earbuds into pairing mode. Good lord they made that difficult. 2.5 hours later I have them paired.","Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2023",AEWFIZHWBDHIZY7EAHSDIM6SXYMA,1,36,Color: Black,Sony WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling in-Ear
806,R1MGV1XOWJJUS5,B0BYPFNW6T,"3.0 out of 5 stars Decent Sound, ANC Not For Airplanes",Artie Deco,3,"These are not bad. They fit my ears well. They are reasonably loud, but they won't be overpowering.The frequency response is pretty good. The associated phone app gives you some equalizer control that helps, too.There is some configurability for the buttons. Not completely customizable, as the actions are grouped across numbers of clicks (e.g. 1: pause, 2: next track, 3: previous track are a group). But I like the defaults, anyway.I also like the tactile buttons. You rarely accidentally push them while adjusting the buds, unlike touch buttons. There is definitely a significant delay for them to respond (I'm guessing a lot of this is waiting to see how many clicks you're going to do to determine which action to take), so the actual mechanical click lets you know you've pressed them.They did not hurt at all, even on 9-10 hr flights.And the battery life so far is crazy good. With ANC enabled, they were still about 15% after use for those entire long flights. Without ANC, they were like 80%! (That'll likely change with age.)But, the ANC is not useful for me. I bought these for airplane travel. A very old set of ANC headphones did wonderfully eliminating the airplane noise. These, not so much. They physically seal well, so they block sound pretty well with no ANC enabled. In the airplane, turning on the ANC changes the sound, but seems to trade one you can hear for another at roughly the same volume. On one 9 hr flight, this was a bit preferable. But it didn't make much difference on the other. They also didn't block crying babies better with ANC than without. However, they were plenty loud to drown out that noise with or without ANC.The passthrough mode is functional, but poor quality. It lets though the ambient sound, but it somehow boosts actual noise. Airplanes have air blowing all the time. Without the earbuds, you don't really notice it much. But with these in & turned to the monitor mode, the hiss of the air is very loud. But again, it's still functional for listening, even while being annoying.As mentioned, I bought these for airplane travel. I have Google Pixel Buds that have no ANC. Comparing to these, the seal is better with the Sonys, even though the ANC doesn't do much for airplane noise. And the equalizer allows adjustments that the Google Buds don't. Including the battery life & buttons, I've decided to keep these. But just be aware of the ANC limits.","Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2023",AECD3NAKI2EFV3AV2WSRPK3ZRQFA,1,36,Color: Black,Sony WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling in-Ear

815,R1QMGR8WHUBKMQ,B0BYPFNW6T,4.0 out of 5 stars Beyond Expectations for Budget Earbuds,Trenton,4,"I can be pretty sensitive to noise, so I've been looking for a good, yet affordable set of noise-cancelling headphones for a while now, but have always been wary of cheaper models. I decided to give these a shot after listening to Sony's C720N's, and so far I've been pleasantly surprised!Noise-Cancelling:What really blew me away was the quality of the noise-cancellation for the price. I didn't have high hopes given that I only paid around $100, but after using these for the past week I've been pretty satisfied with their performance. I would say these earbuds are really good at filtering out lower-end noise, like fans, traffic, and TVs as well as more distant sound. I walked past an industrial AC unit on my way to work the other day and barely heard the thing, especially with music playing. These don't really excel with dealing with higher-end or particularly loud noises like close speech, dogs barking, or sirens, but they do significantly lower the sound, which is incredibly helpful for me. Turning the NC on with music playing is usually enough to block out the majority of offensive noise.Audio:The sound is also really well-balanced right out-of-the-box with good low-end and clear mids and highs unlike the flat or muddy sound you might get with other low-price headphones. Sony's app also allows you to customize your EQ further to get a mix that better suits your preferences, which is really nice. Speaking of the app, you can customize what the buttons on each earbud do through it and toggle the Adaptive Noise-Cancelling setting as well.Comfort:The earbuds themselves are honestly pretty comfortable and fit in my ears snugly. I don't feel them come loose at all as I'm moving about, and I can wear them for hours at a time without much issue. I haven't tried exercising or running with them yet, though. I have been running into a bit of discomfort in my left ear after a couple hours of wear, but I think that may have more to do with the shape of my ear since my right side is fine. I've just been letting the left earbud sit slightly away from the ear for now. which has been helping mitigate any discomfort with out sacrificing any noise-cancellation.Battery-Life:I use my earbuds with noise-cancellation on for at least two-four hours each day. When I'm done using them, they go back into their case to charge. In the week since I bought them, I've only had to charge the case twice. For me, that's not bad at all. The case has an LED indicator to let you know when your charge is getting low, and you can also check it via the app. Charging only takes a couple of hours.All in all, I've been pretty happy with these. I think they're a surprisingly good pair of earbuds for the price. The noise-cancelling of course won't compete for Sony's top-end models, but these do the job and they do it much better than expected.","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2023",AHQFE3IETHLN5VJGRSROS3ZIEGOA,1,36,Color: Black,Sony WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling in-Ear

829,R54TAZM3P539,B0BYPFNW6T,5.0 out of 5 stars True ANR Nlise canceling,DD1550,5,"For those of you who want to purchase this product PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW. I'm going to try and make this short and accurate as possible. Many will tell you that the ANR noise reduction is just a bunch of white noise. THIS IS FALSE! This Bluetooth headset has two modes. ANR and a mode that is sort of a surround sound microphone mode. You can toggle between ANR and surround sound microphone mode with a single tap of the left headset button. You will know when you are in ANR mode because it will be very difficult to hear anything you are surrounded by while you have these headphones in your ears. You will also notice the sound of the music you are listening to is very sharp and clear with lots of bass. The surround sound micro phone mode helps you to hear the environment around you. They sort of turn into microphones and amplify surrounding sounds so you can hear them. This is too often misinterpreted as ANR white noise. Often when wearing these, you will get someone walking up to you talking, trying to communicate, but whatever they are saying will be inaudible if in ANR mode. If this happens, tap the left headset button once. This stops ANR mode and you will be able to hear them talking while still hearing music playing. For best results, tap the right headset button, it stops the music or whatever you are listening to. Then tap the left headset to get out of ANR mode so you can hear the person or environment you are in without removing the headphones from your ears. Its a really cool feature to have on these. The battery life is ok. My headphones will stop functioning at about 6.5 hours of use. Which is acceptable for me for the price. If 6.5 hours of use sounds ok for the price you pay for these, then get them. They are a good bluetooth headset for the money and DON'T LET THE REVIEWS WITH MISLEADING INFO BE A DECIDING FACTOR!!","Reviewed in the United States February 11, 2024",AHDOGFOOXLQ6SC2NVWODUFM4QRRA,1,16,Color: Black,Sony WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling in-Ear
830,RWT29BUJJGM1V,B0BYPFNW6T,2.0 out of 5 stars For the Money - Not impressed.,Granular,2,"I bought these earbuds to replace a set from a different manufacturer that started to not accept charge after around 3-4 years.First thing I noticed was the clunky application you are encouraged to download to make the most out of the ANC and Audio features. The product comes with literature telling you straight up - Made for Iphone/Ipad.. Works with Android - so right away, I felt a sense of dread because I'm an Android user.Through the setup process, you are asked if it's cool that Sony collects all of that sweet information about who you are, how you use the device, your mother's maiden name, etc.I clicked yes, because the audio without the app was on par with the 20 dollar set you can buy at the gas station. WITH the app, you are then asked if you want to install ANOTHER app that will make full use of the ""capabilities"" of the new earbuds you just bought.. for ~$100.. and that you MIGHT have to pay the digital audio fluffers a subscription to use their services. I declined this option and decided to see what the Sony app could do to digitally optimize the sound quality with what I assume are cheap and (too) small audio drivers.Long story short:-The bass is lacking.. seriously lacking - you have to turn the bass setting up to max to achieve what I would consider normal for an in-ear earbud.-The mids and highs are ok - nothing special about the sound.-The active noise cancelling is ok - probably better than the set it was intended to replace (but those were 4 years old.. and older model when I bought them)If you're going to spend ~$100 for a set of everyday use earbuds, I would look elsewhere. The set of Jabra Elite Active 75T's this was supposed to replace blow these away in terms of audio quality (no I don't get paid to write reviews.. yes I only write reviews when a product fails to meet my expectations).Unfortunately, I need these for work over the next few weeks - so I won't be returning them.. but I am VERY Underwhelmed.-","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2024",AH7EAOWJE7ETS2SCSOQDAI7OBHEQ,1,0,Color: Black,Sony WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling in-Ear

I got mine for under 100 dollars, which is basically a steal for how much I love them. I also can't get enough of the physical button on the side in lieu of just having touch controls. The buds are secured in the carrying case with very strong magnets. Would recommend if you aren't going exclusively for the noise cancelation. It's fine, but not class leading.

The low end is more encompassing and punchy without ever compromising clarity and quality of the other frequencies.I was a bit concerned about the lack of frequencies available for the graphic eq but these concerns proved to be unwarranted as I don't need to adjust anything.These ear buds sound so good, I just leave the eq flat and adjust the ""clear bass"" function as needed for extreme music changes.These are my first noise canceling earbuds (as opposed to just noise isolating) so I can't compare to comment too much on the ability here but they definitely reduce background noise.The ambient mode is pretty handy when you need to hear what's going on around you.With the new software update, these modes (noise canceling, ambient, off) are switchable with a simple click of the ear buds (as well as many other customizable click functions).As well, the size of the earbuds / charging case is small enough to put in my jeans pocket and not be annoying or uncomfortable.I have only had these for a few days so I can't comment on longevity but so far, I am really enjoying these earbuds.There are a lot of features, amazing sound quality, high comfort level and all at surprisingly reasonable price point.

So basically I have to tape them down EVERY TIME I want to charge them and even still one of them might not charge and yes I have cleaned the heck out of them. Another major issue is the fact they stay connected after putting them in the case so the battery will continue to drain. I have to manually disconnect them every time I put them back. Last thing, the caseâ€™s battery life is not very long. My Raycons case would last weeks at times(or it felt like) and the Sony case lasts like 2 days tops. As for the fit, itâ€™s about mid level. I typically have a hard time finding headphones that wonâ€™t fall out of my ears(why I loved the raycon pros) and these are better than most but do manage to fall out once in awhile.These issues are a shame because like I said, the sound quality is great for the price and play time is great.

One side would stop playing and would have to forget the device and connect once again. Just to repeat minutes later. Ive used them for around 450 hours when it began having issues. Then the left button stopped working and everytime its clicked, the earbud would turn off for around 10 seconds and then turn on. And it also began to do the same the the right one, with the slightest touch making it unusable until reconnected by forgetting device and reconnecting. Bad durability, stability. But the charge is good. Not worth the money. The case is also a bit annoying to carry on your pocket. I currently have 960 hours on them and the right one basically gave up. Disconnecting once it touches your pocket or case.","Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2024",AG7O3A4FV6TBTBG7ATNAXAGWMNHQ,1,1,Color: Black,Sony WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling in-Ear

In my opinion, these are the best value. Like most Sony electronics, they're just a little bit better and more thoughtfully designed than the competition, in almost every respect, from the audio quality, to the crispness of the button press, to the way they snap effortlessly into the case, to the finish and feel of the plastics used in the buds and their case.The Jabras are slightly better acoustically and have wireless charging, but they're almost twice as expensive and have slightly less refined build quality. For example, the case is smooth plastic without any distinguishing notches to facilitate no-look use, and the buds are kind of confusing to put back.The Ankers are just great, too, but they're a shade less robust in audio quality and a little flimsier. For $20 bucks more than the Ankers, and almost $70 or so less than the Jabras, these Sony buds are the way to go IMHO.","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2023",AEBZIZZHNUBQHOYRQLUT4LDRVNKQ,1,2,Color: Black,Sony WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling in-Ear

At first I was a little underwhelmed by the way they sounded, but after tweaking the equalizer on the app, I had punchy bass and crisp treble. The app also allows you to make use of an impressive list of features. The earbuds themselves are tiny and very comfortable, and the battery life is impressive. I recently wore them for six hours straight on a long (and delayed) flight, and they still had a 50% charge when I put them back in the case. While the noise cancelling function doesnâ€™t neutralize every single sound, they do a good job of quieting the drone of jet engines, air-conditioners, and tires. A pass-through feature allows you to hear other people talking when you need to. For phone calls, the call volume is too low, and of course your own voice is muffled by the in-ear design. The only real complaint that I have, however, is that is almost impossible to get them in your years without pushing the otherwise generously sized multi-function play button.

You get 3 eartip sizes, none of which really worked for me.

901,R2EFM9QEJB3NTK,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive Sound and Functionality,ETaylor,5,"I am impressed with everything about these earbuds.TL;DR--Great sound quality. Quite comfortable. Surprisingly good app. Easily customizable features. Consistent, reliable bluetooth connectivity. Overall, outstanding value.BACKGROUND: The last set of earbuds I owned were non-brand wireless buds that cost about $40 a couple years ago, and they were garbage. In the meantime, I've used a pair of compact Bose on-ear wireless headphones, which are incredibly comfortable and provide amazing sound clarity, but I wanted something smaller and easier to carry around for use at the office. All further remarks about these Anker earbuds are in comparison to my Bose headphones.SOUND: The clarity and quality of sound these earbuds produce is remarkable. It's not quite on the level of the Bose overall, but I never expected it to be on account of these being earbuds and less than half the price.However, the bass that these earbuds pump out is what really blew me away on first use! The Bose headphones are actually a bit weak on bass, whereas these earbuds provide an impressive thump without distorting or sacrificing clarity across the rest of the frequency range. I'm not saying they have good bass *for ear buds,* I'm saying they pump out the bass, *period.*For reference, this is based on listening to EDM tracks from Pretty Lights and Tycho.COMFORT: They're buds, which are understandably less comfortable for a lot of folks than on-ear or over-ear headphones. But for earbuds, they are quite comfy.The rubber pieces that actually go in your ear are soft and pliable, and they come with FIVE different sizes of those. They fit snugly without feeling like they're stretching my ear canal.I haven't done any running or other major activity with them, but I've never felt at risk of one falling out while just walking around my office.NOISE ISOLATION/CANCELATION: This is actually the first set of noise canceling headphones/earbuds I've ever owned, so I can't compare that functionality to anything else, but I will say this: My office runs white noise machines all the time. When these connect to my phone and the noise cancellation begins, the drone from those machines (which I don't even realize I notice beforehand) suddenly goes completely silent.They also effectively reduce the sound of co-workers talking nearby--not completely, but far more than just putting plugs in my ears would do. (Speaking of noise isolation--just blocking sound by plugging your ears--these do more than any earbuds I've previously owned.)Finally, the different modes of noise cancellation that can be set through the app (more on that shortly) seem reasonably effective, but I haven't put them to the test in a variety of environments yet.BATTERY LIFE: I don't remember this being stated in the description, maybe because it's a given for wireless earbuds nowadays, but the carrying case functions as a power bank for these babies.I don't know how many times the case will charge the earbuds before needing to be recharged itself because I haven't drained it yet (in two weeks of using them every other day for 2-3 hours per day). When that time comes, I think it's neat that the case can charge wirelessly.It also has a microUSB charging port and comes with a cable, the other end of which is standard USB. Nothing comes with wall bricks anymore, but I guess they figure everyone has a few spare ones around by now.TECHNOLOGY: My first thought on being able to access some of the settings/features of these earbuds only through the app was, ""UGH, another product-specific app?! *grump*"" BUT, this app is remarkably sleek and easy to use. And I say that as someone who works for a software company.Setting the noise cancellation mode and customizing the on-board controls (what happens when you tap the earbuds in different ways during use) is very easy to do. The app also has a sound test feature to help make sure you're wearing the earbuds correctly and have the right size squishy ear piece on them.After initially pairing them with my phone via Bluetooth, the connectivity has worked flawlessly. When I remove them from the case, they connect right away. When I put them back in and close the case, they are disconnected. Every time. No fiddling with settings or having to re-pair.That consistent reliability is very nice, especially for phone calls. If the buds are in my ears, that's where the call comes in. If they're in the case, it comes through the phone speaker. No juggling devices or frantically pressing buttons to sort out where the sound will come out of next. The calls are clear, and the built-in microphones must pick up my voice well enough because I've had no complaints from anyone on the other end.I haven't tested the Bluetooth range on them because my phone is always on me when I'm using them.CONSTRUCTION: Solid build, clear attention to detail. The earbuds pop into the case with a satisfying little snap.The magnet that holds them in is very secure, so even with the case open I'm not worried about them falling out, but not so strong that they're difficult to remove.The case itself is terrifically compact and sturdy. The lid shuts securely, and would clearly protect the earbuds while bouncing around in a purse or backpack all day.SUMMARY: These are great earbuds. For the price, they're amazing earbuds. I know the technology is always advancing, but these do SO MUCH for $70, and they do all of it remarkably well. I've been going out of my way to recommend them to people, which is why I've written this novel of a review. If you've read this far, I certainly hope you've found it helpful. :)","Reviewed in the United States November 5, 2022",AE32IG42QNFSNTCIBWQBOOSMU6PA,1,327,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

I need something that works at the gym, on airplanes, while gardening, washing dishes, and driving. The Soundcore Life P3 is the first I've found that can do it ALL.The active noise cancellation is superb, and you can control it via the app or just by touch of the earbuds. I've had other earbuds that say they cancel noise but they don't even come close to these.The range of connection while listening to music, etc. all over my house (inside and outside) is important for me. I don't always bring my phone when I am going around the house, garage, yard, and these stay connected at least 90% of the locations i roam to at the edges of my yards--through closed doors.The quality of connection while in conversation is excellent, no complaints. The water resistance holds up to the IPX5 standard which is just what i need due to sweat & sometimes I (carefully) wash my face with them in.The battery life is excellent. They last a few days without needing to be plugged back into an outlet. The earbuds recharge in 10-15 minutes with the portable charging case. The charging case is even something to rave about! It is small and soft to the touch yet sturdy & durable. I do wish the magnetic closure was a little stronger but that is only because i often drop things & if you drop the case then the earbuds pop out (half the time). But I can honestly say that is my only complaint about these earbuds.I realize I sound like a paid advertisement but I am not - I just LOVE these earbuds. The quality is fantastic, and I think the price is just right: a little expensive but completely worth it.The customer service is the cherry on top! After a couple months of heavy use I had a fluke problem with one earbud and the customer service resolved the issue 100%. They did make me do some extra troubleshooting that was a little painful, and it did resolve the issue for a little while. After that earbud stopped working again I contacted customer service and they could not have been easier or quicker to completely rectify the situation. I am now even more fanatical about this brand.If you're looking for an excellent quality earbud that covers all the bases then you've found it--buy these.It is almost 3 years since I first purchased these & I stand by them 100%. They have taken countless drops, been stepped on a few times, sustained water submersion and still give amazing quality of sound, noise cancellation, and battery life. I have been getting comments about the mic quality on phone calls lately so I will soon replace them as i often use them for work.

903,R1PXZ3RO471MZU,B093SLWMS7,"4.0 out of 5 stars Unexpectedly satisfied! Sound quality, battery life, accessibility all great.",Naglfarslayer,4,"UPDATE (3 October 2022):After less than a year of a typical life (no major damage), each earbud has alternated between working and not working over the last month. For the first two weeks, the left earbud was silent, then it suddenly came back to life and the right one went silent within a couple of days and remains so today. Both headphones finally failed during a Zoom meeting this morning and have not yet been resurrected.While these have been excellent headphones, I am disappointed to experience a serious failure like this after LESS THAN ONE YEAR of responsible use and care.These were everything I wanted in new, EXPENSIVE (>$30) headphones.TL;DR: Great sound range (incl. prominent bass), satisfactory battery life (3-4 hours per charge; case gives ~2-3 recharges), and easy accessibility (two-step connection to device; the SoundCore app has a good widget). They are acceptable for voice calls, however they seem to pick up a lot of ambient background noise (papers shuffling, keyboard clicking, etc.), and my callers say the sound quality is better on my iPhone SE 2020 without the headphones, than with them.ONLY COMPLAINTS: very rarely but consistently, the sound will cut out for ~2 seconds before coming back - I believe this occurs when too many other wireless devices are nearby, as it has not happened at all the past 2 hours I've sat here at my work desk after-hours, but it happens every 1-2 minutes in the gym around many people wearing wireless headphones - CONSULT OTHER REVIEWS to see what the consensus is; I'm used to it by now - it's not a surprise and I miss very little in that small 1-2 sec window.NOTE that in-ear headphones naturally block out a lot of sound; 'Transparency Mode' helps to artificially add back in some environmental noise, but it is difficult to reliably hear people talk nearby.OVERALL: I'm very satisfied with the Anker Life P3. The sound quality is very nice (for a normie lol), the battery stays alive for several hours and charges quickly when returned to the case, and it easily pairs with Bluetooth devices.The origin story:I was reluctant to switch to wireless headphones due to the high prices and ease of losing track of them. I had to switch due to upgrading phones (iPhone SE to iPhone SE 2020, can't you tell I'm a cheapskate lol), and exhaustively researched wireless headphones to find a budget-end pair that still boasted good quality.My priorities were something reliable that would survive through long days in the (chemistry) lab, and during workouts (generic 30-45 min weightlifting or cardio). Many reviews recommended the Anker Life P3 as a solid entry on the lower-mid price range, although AirPods tended to remain the gold standard albeit at a notably higher price. Due to the consistent recommendation between reviewers (website and YouTube), I decided to go for it.The Anker Life P3 met my purchasing goals to a T (and I ride Boston's T system now, so I would know!).FIT: The fit feels nice, and the multiple pairs of rubber ear adapters give a chance for all ear sizes to feel comfortable. They don't fall out easily even when I run (both on the treadmill and *real* running), and they feel secure as I walk around. Minor irritation when my ears decide the 'foreign objects' need to leave, although this is rare.SOUND: I've listened to songs I've played for most of my life, and these earphones have brought out parts of the arrangement I have NEVER heard before. The bass is strong, so the full range of sound is there (no 'weak' or 'high' headphone sound here). In my opinion, the sound is powerful but balanced. Equalizers can probably tweak the sound if you prefer a different mix, but these bad boys can sure thump if you want them to!BATTERY: I usually give up before these headphones do. My typically listening sessions go between 30 min to 3 h and I've never had the batteries die on me. They *feel* like they quickly recharge when returned to the case, which provides another 2-3 full charges. The case can be separately recharged using the USB-C to USB-A cable provided; this takes longer, so charge the case overnight and it will keep the headphones charged for the entirety of the next day. Hardcore music marathoners may be less enthused by the battery life, but the Anker Life P3 has a longer lifespan than me!ACCESSIBILITY: I find the Life P3 to be easy to handle, although the initial linking was a bit confusing (and I already forgot how I did it!). When the headphone case is open, the three front lights turn/stay on for a few seconds. Then, the lights ignite in an alternating pattern, which is when the headphones are seeking a Bluetooth partner. On a device that knows the headphones, clicking on 'Soundcore Life P3' on the Bluetooth list will initiate the pairing, and then you're ready to go! To disconnect, you can remove it from the device, turn off the device Bluetooth, or return the headphones to the case and close the case. Unpaired headphones can be immediately paired with another device without having to be returned to the case. Re-cased headphones will immediately pause music/video streaming on the paired device (on Apple products, in my experience). The 'Soundcore' app for phones (haven't seen it for Mac) is very useful, as it provides some EQ's and the Noise Cancellation or Transparency modes. It also provides a widget for quick access to the Cancellation/Transparency/Normal modes for convenient toggling without having to open the app.Note: The headphone stems have two or three swipe features. I use these sparingly and have not investigated them further. One gesture skips to the next audio (song skip or 'next YouTube video in queue') which is convenient when desired; sometimes it takes me several attempts to gesture in a way the headphones will recognize, but more practice will likely help that.OTHER: As with all in-ear headphones, these naturally block a good 70% of external noise, and loud music will take out another 10-15% on top of that. It is near-impossible to hear people speaking to me with these headphones in; at most I get an inaudible, deep rumble that tells me someone is trying to speak to me. This is fine if you're prepared for it, but it is inconvenient to remove one headphone every time someone speaks to me - consider your intended use and how common this will be for you. The noise cancellation works very well, IMO, as only minor vibrations and deep sounds come through; I've experienced no intelligible talking in the background with that feature on, and bus/subway rides only have a deep hum characteristic of public transportation.ONE COMPLAINT: As mentioned in the TL;DR above, the sound does cut out for 1-2 seconds rarely, although this becomes more common in crowded ares with a higher density of wireless headphones. My hypothesis is that too much Bluetooth air traffic makes it difficult to stay connected to the signal, but I have no idea. This has only been a major issue in the gym, where the phenomenon seems frequent and consistent; I've only taken these to the gym two or three times, though. Check other reviews!OVERALL: I am quite satisfied with these headphones. $70 for exactly what I wanted? YES! When I inevitably drop one of the headphones down a storm drain, I will definitely look for another pair of Anker Life P3, or consider their other similar products.","Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2022",AHRON4BBXZLET3OZA2LRPMNSJ3ZA,1,233,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

No, but theyâ€™re also 75% cheaper.The good:* Battery life - 6-8 hours (over 24hrs with case)* Soundcore app - lots of customization and built in natural sounds to help you relax, focus, or sleep. Some sounds it offers are wind, rain, thunder, ocean, trains, etc. it very effective and a genius idea.* price point - you wonâ€™t find better earbuds at a better price than this. The overall value for what you get is better than ANY other earbuds on the market.* wireless charging case* usb-c charging case* call quality is awesome. Whether you use one in an ear or both, the call quality is loud, clear for both parties involved and effective.* the fit is very good and comes with multiple ear tips for different sizes of ears.The OK:* decent quality noise cancellation - not great* decent quality active listening - better than averageCould be better:* volume - the volume is sufficient, but I really wish it got louder for those gym sessions where you really want to get that extra pump or push to power you through to the end.Final synopsis:* like I said earlier, you will not find a better bang for your buck. Sure, you can get some premium qualities from other brands, but at a premium price. You get pretty darn close to premium qualities from these at a ridiculous value. This is a no brainer to me. Even if buy these as a â€œbackupâ€ for your gym bag, office, whatever in case you forget your go to pair, you wonâ€™t regret it.","Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2024",AEI5P4SI2X7XYWOL5KT3DUAFASIA,1,6,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds
906,R3BBEJ31ICODZB,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars These buds are part of my life now.,Trucker Frank,5,"I absolutely love these ear buds!Comfort:I've never been a fan of ear buds in general because they've always hurt my ears but these don't. They are very comfortable and I can actually wear them for over an hour without them bothering me.Sound:The sound out of these little things is awesome! Loud, clear and full sound. Great bass which surprised me because I didn't expect it. Nice clear highs that don't sound like tin.Noise Cancelling:I've been using these in very noisy environments and they do extremely well. I work in trucking and my favorite place to use these is in the yard truck at the terminal while moving trailers around. It's an old beat up terminal tractor that just makes a ton of noise and clanks, bangs, shakes, and in general just a loud annoying place to be. These ear buds bring all that noise to a slight hum. With the music at half volume you barely hear the noise at all. Also did an excellent job at keeping things quiet while running the snow blower on my driveway.Transparency Mode:This feature works as expected. Not sure what else to say about it really lol. If I keep the music at a quarter volume I can hold a conversation with people even in a warehouse environment without feeling like I have to shout over the music or guess what they're trying to tell me. They also have a vocal mode in the software which actually makes some voices clearer when the person is at a distance and standing next to a noisy truck.Phone calls:They sound great and the caller can hear me perfectly too! I was blown away by this because going back to the terminal tractor I was talking about in the noise cancelling part of this review it's noisy... But the caller and I can clearly hold a conversation and it sounds great on both sides of the call. On a side note, the call sounds and goes smoothly even with a winter beeny hat over them WHILE DRIVING that insanely noisy truck!Battery life:The battery life has been great for my use case. I don't really wear them for very long in one shot like other people might. But, I've never had them go low on me and I've been on the same charge for the past 3 weeks with using them about 2 to 3 hours a day 5 days out of the week and I pretty much exclusively use noise cancelling or transparency modes. With that in mind when I put them back in the case I still get the 3 lights for state of charge.The Case:THANK YOU ANKER for pretty much having USB-C on everything you guys make and not putting Micro B on the lower cost products! Seriously, I really appreciate that. The case itself is great too. The ear buds snap in nice and easy when putting them away without fumbling. The shape of it feels good in my inside coat pocket which I know is subjective but I can say it's definitely not an annoying thing to carry. The cover is a cover lol. It closes nice, doesn't flop open and doesn't feel flimsy. The 3 lights show battery state of charge and light up for bud engagement confirmation when placing a bud in the case which is nice.Bluetooth:Works fantastic as you'd expect out of a device these days. Paired instantly with my phone on the first try. Doesn't cut out or cause any fuss and it's not laggy.Cons:I really haven't found any. But if I really had to be picky... I wish the volume control was a swipe gesture instead of a tap. It would be nice if they told you battery percentage when you turn the buds on. And I wish I had a case for the case, which may sound silly but a clamshell zipper case would be nice to have just to keep them extra safe. Honestly, I love these things so much that I'd probably cry if anything happened to them lol.","Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2022",AH3522A3DKI4ERI334G4H5CTXSJA,1,57,Color: Navy Blue,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds
907,R1RFFM4500JQBQ,B093SLWMS7,3.0 out of 5 stars Goodâ€¦ But not for everyone,Amazon Customer,3,"Donâ€™t get me wrong. These Bluetooth earbuds are really good. But before you let me tell you why I am rating them 3 stars. Letâ€™s start with the pros of these earbuds shall we. Bluetooth (true wireless), water resistant, noise cancellation, good batter life, and the software (app I should say) is perfect for custom controls. Now what are cons, the noise canceling is slightly there, Iâ€™m outside working with machinery and the noise bleeds right through (even using the settings in the app to keep for noise canceling outdoor, indoor, and transport) even having the on transport still bleeds in noise. Lightly plug your ears with your fingers and yup you got the full effect. The loudness of these earbuds is non existent. I was using these earbuds while my dad was jamming on the radio. I didnâ€™t even hear my song with the volume all the way up with the highest noise canceling settings. Like I said they are great but not for everyone. If you never had noise canceling headphones or earbuds before. I highly recommend these so you can get started. Iâ€™m sure working inside or walking in public these are probably great, but if you are like me using a lawn mower then these are probably not worth your 74 bucks.","Reviewed in the United States August 2, 2024",AFLLR7467DM5L73ZOSVVOHWEBMQQ,1,0,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

Very good for the price, with a couple of minor bugs.",LCB,5,"I wanted earbuds that offered good quality for classical music at a decent price. After checking online reviews I ordered these.Pros:1. Sound: Sound quality is quite well balanced. The app for these buds includes an equalizer that allows you to types of music (jazz, classical, electronic, etc., etc., etc...). The equalizer also has a custom feature that allows you to customize your sound.2. App: The app is very intuitive, and in addition to the equalizer, includes controls for ambient sound (noise cancellation), gaming mode, tip fit test, etc.. It also shows you how to set up the buds right out of the box. and allows you to customize the tap settings, etc. I haven't used it for phone calls, but some reviewers say they work well.3. Charging: You can use a USB cable or a wireless charging pad to charge it.Cons:1. User manual: The included manual is useless. It's printed in tiny light blue font on white (Why? Why? Oh Why?). I downloaded the pdf version of the manual and had to blow it up to read it.The good news is that you can ditch the manual and use the app, which explains everything you need.2. Ear Tips: It includes several size ear-tips, but as other reviewers noted, they don't do a good job of securing the buds. Fortunately I had a set of ""LUDOS Comfy Earbuds Replacement Memory Foam Ear Tips"" (Available on Amazon). These come in several sizes and colors including dayglow (makes finding the buds easier). They work perfectly.3. Noise cancellation: The app allows you to select different cancellation modes. Although noise-cancellation is not perfect, it's good for most environments.Final notes: These are not on a league with $200.00 plus earbuds, but if you are on a budget, you get a lot of bang for the buck at $70.00.","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2024",AGNBGS4QA2RI5FO2QNVRNYVHW26A,1,5,Color: Oat White,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds
909,R1QYXYTK0TIXIJ,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent warranty and customer service,ImmaDad,5,"About a year with my Life P3 and the left earbud gave up the ghost. Looking back at the last few weeks I think there were signs that I wrote off as little glitches. Things like the mic not working until I reconnected and the audio balance between left and right earbuds being very noticeable.Then last week the left ear just stopped working. I did all the things suggested on the site (cleaning the connections with rubbing alcohol, delete and resetup connection, making sure itâ€™s fully charged, etc etc etc.) but no luck.Poking around the Soundcore site I see that the earbuds are covered under an 18 month warranty so a few hours after filling out their online form I receive the first of 3 emails advising that I do all the things I did already to see if that would get the earbud to work. As annoying as that is, I get they need to make sure customers are putting in the effort.I respond back letting them know I did each of the troubleshooting suggestions but apparently I wasnâ€™t clear enough about the rubbing alcohol cleaning because I received the 2nd of my 3 emails stating I need to make sure the connecting points are cleaned which I responded back more carefully this time, making sure to include keywords so the bots know I did my part. The following day I get the 3rd and final email apologizing for the issue and telling me that I should expect a new pair of replacement buds to come out to me in about a week's time.I took that turnaround time with a grain of salt and assumed I would probably see it in a month since I wasnâ€™t sure where it was coming from and how quickly they would have it in a box.2 days later, I come home and thereâ€™s a box at my door. just 2 days and I have my new earbuds. I am so impressed by their turnaround that Iâ€™m willing to overlook the robo emails I had to go through before getting to this part.I am really impressed by their customer service and have another reason to want to continue to be an Anker customer.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AEBDM5LJPHTASBUTRXQWS56IB3TQ,1,1,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds
910,RHZIA9ZSQ6PPW,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible Value,jdan318,5,"About 2 years ago I bought a pair of these, but recently lost them. I thought of getting a more expensive pair to replace them, but decided these did well enough before. I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I am a musician, often mix live sound, and have owned many different pairs of decent open-backed and IEM headphones over the years, so I have some experience with sound quality.The sound quality on this new pair seems near identical to the old ones, which is good for music and videos, but both the battery and noise cancelation is noticeably improved on this newer pair. I would have been happy with an identical product, but the improvements make me very glad I didn't spend money on more expensive wireless earbuds, as these are more than decent, they are good, and for the money I dare say they are great.Update: Went on my first flight, so can give a more comprehensive review on the noise canceling. For cars I've been a passenger in, it eliminates road noise to the point I can't hear it. For a 737 when I'm in a window seat right behind the engine, it eliminates a lot of noise, but it certainly is still there. Still, turning it off then on again showcased that it still was bringing it down a ton, but these are not complete elimination (like I've read the Bose are).Still, while these are great at eliminating road, engine, and wind noise, what they do almost nothing for is voices. They do fit flush in my ear and create a seal, which does an okay job of bringing down talking and crying, but I still clearly heard babies crying during the flights. In the airport terminal, the indoor mode did lower the din of many people talking, but anything remotely close where you could listen to what they are saying still comes through. It does something, and for the price still is fine, but don't expect anything close to silence when surrounded by people talking.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AEI62QY4IKCSR6XXPL3GY5ZONRYA,1,1,Color: Navy Blue,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

Unfortunately that wasnâ€™t really in the budget, so I started looking for alternatives.First, sound quality is pretty great! Thereâ€™s an app where you can adjust the sound settings as well. They have a noise cancelling, transparency, and normal mode just like AirPods do, and thereâ€™s an equalizer available if youâ€™re someone who likes to adjust things more specifically to your tastes.Second, they pair to my phone pretty easily. I was worried the process would feel clunky since AirPods connect with no effort to Apple products, but once you pair them initially, they connect seamlessly.They fit really well due to the four silicone ear piece size options. I have small ears and the XS tips fit perfectly.Overall super happy with these!

913,R25Y31E25PM4WU,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars (EDIT) Left earbud isnâ€™t working with ANC or ambient noise modes,McScruff8188,4,"Edit:After purchasing a different pair a few months after this incident it was a completely different experience and for the extortionately low cost of the Anker Soundcore life P3, along with the five shades of beautiful eye catching colors (my personal favorite was the coral red, however the baby blue variant is absolutely stunning as well! Iâ€™m now using the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 in a dark cherry red color which I find sexy and if we were to compare the two versions, of course weâ€™d know which would come out on top due to the numerous different flagship level features but if youâ€™re on a budget and are looking for another brand in this particular price range, I highly recommend you stop and pick up a pair of these. They have everything you could want in a nice pair of earbuds. I donâ€™t really use the ANC modes on any of my earbuds unless itâ€™s by accident but I can assure you that the ambient sound mode is top tier, the sound profile is dang near flawless and the app has a host of other different equalizer presets and you can also use the EQ settings to adjust the sound to your own liking. Iâ€™m a huge Apple fanboy and though I do love the AirPods Pro 2, I think that Anker has them beat in a few different areas, especially with my latest earbuds. My three favorite bands are Anker, Sony linkbuds S, and though I have yet to test them out, Iâ€™m trying to make it a goal to get a pair of the Technics MAH-AZ60M2 in the flashy blue color. But I will never, even if I were rich, be able to justify a $250 price tag on a pair of earbuds that you can get similar results with a $115 or less on the Anker Soundcore earbuds. It doesnâ€™t matter what model you purchase, they have all different kinds that suit each individual. I am going through some of my older, lazily made reviews and am going to update them with a long term follow-up on most of the items, especially if I have found pictures of the ones that I failed to provide at the time of my initial review and will change my opinion and recommendations accordingly to make sure that everyone is given an unbiased view and opinion that will help you better understand the products you might want to purchase. But I would definitely recommend these earbuds and I actually wish I wouldâ€™ve gotten a pair for an emergency in case the ones Iâ€™m using go out on me. Thatâ€™s dreaming big right now since I canâ€™t even afford my cellular bill nor my rent. Of course nobody is willing to help me with my current situation and expects me to pull money out of my a$& and drive to the next city over to the UPS store where I get rejected by this very mean and rude old lady who apparently hates her job and everyone else too. Also this has nothing to do with this product review but I would be very cautious about dealing with UPS. I have lost a lot of money and items via their â€œpremium servicesâ€ and even just simple returns have never been heard from in months. They encourage you to take the items to your local Kohlâ€™s (which is literally a mile down the road from where I live and could easily walk there) but it seems that the more I have a very serious problem that needs addressing right then, they go out of their way to be the worst human beings they can. Iâ€™ve been stuck in a customer service chat for literally over 13 hours before, on more than one occasion where I was transferred to a different representative every few minutes and that caused me to not make it to my Kohlâ€™s before they closed last night so I just stopped the chat because I am clogging my phone with screenshots of not so good behavior and practices. But I just canâ€™t stand the fact that you have people who abuse the system every day and I actually do the right thing and actually interact with the company to seek help and I feel like I am getting the middle finger every time. Not from you Anker youâ€™re awesome! Iâ€™m just speaking out loud.

Comparing this to my previous ones (Earfun Air Pro 3, Earfun Air Pro), these Soundcore Life P3 knock it out of the park when it comes to background noise isolation in calls. Absolute night and day difference. I did a test in a noisy room (fan/air noise from a large HVAC unit) and these were so much clearer. The background noise was almost non-existent. I bought these primarily based on reviews of excellent call quality, and so far that has been true. I'll be testing more with phone calls as time goes on. As far as sound goes when listening to music, the quality seems top-notch, especially for the price point (I was able to snag these on sale). Personal preference, but I like the Soundcore Signature equalizer setting. It also has a BassUp option that I like as well. Upon opening the case, they pair very quickly with my phone.So far, my only dislikes/gripes with these are: 1) lack of ear/proximity detection and 2) lack of multi-device (multipoint) connection. With today's bluetooth technology, I don't understand why the multi-device connection is missing. My Earfun Air Pro has it and I didn't pay any more for them than I did these. (Earfun Air Pro 3 also lack this feature.) I can and will live without the ear detection, but having to constantly disconnect and reconnect between my phone and computer is going to be an annoyance more than anything. Had these Soundcore Life P3 included this, I would have given them five stars, even without the ear detection.","Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2024",AFILWMLMEEVRAD4OAQJ2T6XSBIFA,1,0,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

I'm also very clumsy, resulting in these headphones experiencing many hip-height drops to concrete floors. Despite this, they have lasted me much longer than any other earbud has to date at 20 months of constant use and abuse - and they are only giving out in the sense that the dwindled battery life (expected of rechargeable batteries vs. replaceable batteries) is becoming a nuisance when I can't constantly switch them in the lab. Good sound quality and noise canceling with customizing available through the manufactures app. Until recently, I have been getting 8-9 hours of battery life per earbud and only changing the case once per week. I have occasionally struggled with bluetooth connectivity not recognizing the device, though I suspect this is linked to drops and repairing the device solves the problem quickly. Fit of the in ear buds is good, though not perfect and occasionally require adjusting or result in slipping.Ultimately, I would and have recommended these to coworkers and friends, and will be buying a new pair to refresh battery longevity for personal convenience.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2024",AHDJAENYQDKRYRMNDEDFMANLQB6A,1,0,,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds
919,RB5NJ0AUTC858,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing bass and great ANC,Andrew,5,"Itâ€™s amazing how much quality and great features youâ€™re getting at this price point. I honestly didnâ€™t know what to expect, since Iâ€™m used to buying much more expensive gear, so I wasnâ€™t expecting much. I gotta say, I was pleasantly surprised! They sound GREAT, extra, full range, deep bass, but the rest of the frequency range sounds good. Definitely not muddy or overbearing, I listened to rock as well as bass heavy electronic tracks and all sounded great.Comfort:Comfort for me is the #1 thing when it comes to earbuds or headphones. It doesnâ€™t matter how good they sound or how good the ANC or features are if theyâ€™re not comfortable! These fit the bill nicely. I had never worn stem style earbuds before, but it doesnâ€™t really make a noticeable difference to your comfort anyway, you canâ€™t feel the stem. These are light and donâ€™t apply pressure to any area on my ear that would otherwise lead to discomfort (like most of the other earbuds in the market that are unnecessarily large, like the new Sony WF-1000XM4). I can wear these for hours with no discomfort whatsoever, so we got a winner here.ANC: The ANC on these is a bit different than what Iâ€™m used to, as Iâ€™ve never owned earbuds with ANC, just cans like my beloved Bose QC35â€™s and my JBL Tour One, of which the Bose obviously is the king. Well, when compared to my Bose, these Life P3â€™s do a pretty good job of muffling the heavy, industrial fan I have in my room, and in some cases blocking out different frequencies better than the Bose. The fan just sounds different. Maybe it's not as quiet as with the Bose but the pitch it gets on these is very subdued. (I have a VERY loud fan in my room on purpose so as to have a very loud white noise that I can sleep to while drowning out the rest of the outside noises that wake me otherwise). The thing about the ANC on these earbuds is that it has 3 modes, transit, indoor and outdoor. I found indoor to be the best for me personally around the house, it brought a very impressive level of attenuation. I could still clearly hear my dogs barking but all the other, more constant noises went VERY silent. In some cases it feels more silent than the Bose cans do, and those are among the best ANC performers on the market. Donâ€™t get me wrong, the Bose are still kings in that regard, but it does by no means put these buds to shame, they stand up surprisingly well. I wish there was an option for selecting â€œmaximumâ€ ANC where it would mix the 3 options, because while standing next to my fan, I went through all 3 and they each blocked a different frequency range from the fan and changed its pitch and perceived loudness. Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™re capable of consolidating all 3 and bringing even more impressive ANC but I suspect they donâ€™t do this in order to not hurt their flagship. Just my guess but regardless, the ANC performance in these buds is nothing to scoff at and I am actually very happy with and impressed by them in that regard. Transparency mode on these is also very good, you donâ€™t have to take your buds out in order to have a conversation or be aware of your surroundings. I have mine set to long press to switch between ANC on and Ambient aware on. Which brings me to the next plus, the touch controls on these earbuds is actually decent, unlike my JBL Tour One where adjusting my headset often times results in activating the touch controls unintentionally. That doesnâ€™t happen with these buds.Find my buds:This has a feature where it makes your buds make a loud noise so you can find them. Pretty neat if you ask me, Iâ€™m thinking of getting a pair of these for my mother, since sheâ€™s constantly losing everything.In conclusion:Iâ€™m very happy with my purchase, I have included many pictures so you can see what you get when you buy these and what it all looks like. I would definitely recommend these to anyone, for the money, they canâ€™t be beat and even if they were more expensive, Iâ€™m sure most would be happy with them.","Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2021",AHHTZ2TA4U5S7CZCQPODGDD6VVMQ,1,53,,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

922,R2OE9ZT9T14GIG,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent mid-range earbuds,Amazon Customer,5,"I bought these to replace some cheap earbuds I bought when I was studying for the bar and not working and had zero money ($34.99).Iâ€™ve only had these a few days but so far, these are totally worth the price ($69.99 less a discount)!The case has a soft touch non-slip coating, and the way the lid closes feels much higher quality than my prior earbuds. The earbuds themselves fit my small ears quite nicely, and it comes with a set of different sizes of ear piece (S to XL). I like that you can change the noise cancellation settings and customize the EQ. It also has a ton of EQ presets tailored for different types of music (havenâ€™t tried them out yet but seems pretty extensive).My favorite part is that you can customize the touch settings (see last photo)!! I actually didnâ€™t realize you could when I bought them, didnâ€™t know about the feature until I set them up. Each earbud can have different settings, too.Iâ€™ve always hated the touch play/pause feature on my other earbuds because when I need to brush my hair behind my ear and accidentally brush the button and it pauses my music, and canâ€™t wear earbuds under winter hats because the movement of the fabric makes it play/pause. Now, I am able to turn off all single-touch functions, and instead have the long touch as play/pause.These also have a great Bluetooth range. I like to have my earbuds connected to my laptop and â€œwatchâ€ Netflix while Iâ€™m cleaning the house, and I can leave my laptop in the kitchen while walking all over the house (several floors in a funky split-level), including into the garage and out to the dumpster, without the sound cutting out. This is a feat, as the sound usually cuts out when going to the garage or dumpster with other earbuds.Great little earbuds, very happy with my purchase.

Iâ€™m a bass head and the bass from these is unreal. Like having a sub woofer in my house. The mid range and higher frequencies are well balanced too. The Soundcore app equalizer does a great job of fine tuning the music to your liking. The noise cancellation is not the best but itâ€™s good enough for me. For the price I canâ€™t complain.

926,R30TEMP5P2P704,B093SLWMS7,"2.0 out of 5 stars Used to recommend, Now I don't :(",Zak Awry,2,"UPDATE 09/02/21: Although I do still love them I can't recommend them anymore for the following reasons:1. I've found issues with disconnecting them from my phones bluetooth then trying to reconnect them to my computer bluetooth it just tells me it can't connect to the P3's. It's a MAJOR pain to disconnect them from your phone, put them back in their case and close it, open it back up and take them out and disconnect them again from my phone when they automatically reconnect to the last device and finally be able to connect to my computer. I don't know if that's the norm? Or if it's something I'm doing but that's been my experience trying to switch between two devices. Not always, but frequently enough to be a problem.2. Along the lines with connectivity issues, I've also had recent problems where they were connected to my phone and I put them in their case for a length of time (anywhere from 15 mins to an hour) and I grab them out of the case walking out the door to start walking expecting that they'll automatically connected like usual but for some reason they don't/wont reconnect for seemingly no reason. The first time it happened I chalked it up to user error but after a 3rd or 4th time I'm starting to suspect it's product. It's easy to reset them with the case but I don't take the case on walks with me so can be SUPER annoying and unusable for the duration of your walk/activity.3. Today after resetting the head phones I connected them to my computer to listen to music while my phone did a system update. I've frequently had it connected to my computer in the past for Zoom calls and listening to music and videos, etc. Normally when connected to the computer I have the same sound quality I do when connected to my phone, however, today for the first time, after connecting it to my computer the sound quality was TERRIBLE. And I don't mean just kind of bad I mean it sounds like a low quality tape recording from the radio coming out of a blown phone speaker in a bowl (When using a streaming service like Spotify or YouTube). I'm SUPER disappointed in them. I don't know if they did an update that f-ed them all up or what but yikes. Due to the recent issue's I've experienced I've reduced my original 5 star rating down to a 2 star. :( Hopefully their next headphone release will be way better. Maybe the Liberty Air Pro 2's are better?I'm new to the Soundcore Brand but after paying $40 dollars for one of there older earbuds and being blown away I figured I'd pay a little more and try a higher quality ear bud from them and....just wow. These are far better than I was expecting. I might be a little easier satisfied than someone who classifies themselves as an 'audiophile' or someone who needs head phones for music production reasons and although the noise cancelling isn't quite as good as my over the ear Sony WH-1000XM4 but the Life P3's are $270 LESS and they're actually pretty darn close. The P3's have a great fit for your ears, I can do yoga while wearing them and they don't fall out. The App is a very nice touch. Nothing worse than trying to figure out what you're doing pushing and holding buttons like on the Life A1's but not knowing what equalizer you're on. Incredible sound and base and they get SUPER LOUD.Pros:~The App - Gives you a battery life indicator for each head phone, Gives you access to Ambient Sound, Gaming Mode, Equalizer, Controls, Superior sleep sounds, and Tip Fit Test * Gives you 3 ambient sound options Noise Cancellation, Transparency mode, and normal mode. 3 options for noise cancellation - transport, indoor, and outdoor. * Gaming mode - you can turn on to reduce the latency while gaming or watching videos. * Equalizer - gives you the option to custom tune your earbuds or using one of their 21 preset ones. * Controls - lets you customize the touch response on the ear buds to do the controls that you want the most. * Superior Sleep gives you access to 11 ambient sounds to help you fall asleep (although, you're a champion if you can fall asleep with these or any other ear buds in.) * Tip Fit Test - Tests the Tip seal on the head phones to make sure you're getting the most out of your ear buds.~ Tip Selection - Like all of Soundcore ear buds a huge selection of ear tip pieces so you can get a comfortable fit.~ Wireless charging case~ Noise Cancellation - is it the best? Probably not. Will it block out a lot of the noise? Absolutely. I used to have to close my office door every day at work when coworkers would start talking, now my doors wide open and I can't hear any of them.~ Comfort - I was worried that with my ears and everything that they might stick out too far but they sit comfortably inside of my ear and don't stick out far at all. Looks like I have Air pods in.~ So many color options.Cons: There aren't many that I can find.~ No bluetooth Multipoint (Being able to connect to more than one bluetooth at a time.) This is the biggest con for me. (Don't believe any of the Soundcore ear buds have this yet, but may be wrong.)~ No in ear detection when you remove an ear bud to pause music.~ No HearID in the app - I believe that's because that's a Liberty series feature, so I guess it makes sense it's not included.If you're trying to decide between the Liberty Air 2 Pro or the Life P3's I can't see much of a difference between them other than the HearID test. If you have extra money to burn or the HearID is a super important feature you want, I'd honestly stick with the Life P3's and save $50 bucks.I'm hoping on Soundcores next ear bud release will include the in ear detection as well as the multipoint bluetooth connection (Hopefully on the liberty series so I can try the HearID as well).","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2021",AHDPUWA75ZO5ENF3Q2NZ7KFOHIBA,1,123,,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

Keep in mind I use earbuds for at least 5-7 hours a day.Cons:1) Case durability is bad. 1st day out of the box and I already had scratches just from it being alone in my pocket. If you're gonna get the earbuds, get a travel case for them.2) The vocal transparency mode (the one that lets you have conversations while playing music) doesn't let you actually have an understandable conversation without the volume being at 50% and/or being right up next to the person.3) This one's just personal preference, but the bass isn't punchy at all. You can turn on a setting in the app for more punchy bass, but it still doesn't feel like enough.","Reviewed in the United States April 21, 2024",AHONEA7UI7436IZJVLYWCS7ECVRA,1,1,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

943,R3LM0FUS1XHSRB,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Updated to 4 Stars Based on Customer Service/Fixes for several issues,James,4,"Leaving my original review below but changing my review to 4 stars based on the customer service. I reached out to Anker about my issues below and their CSR was very responsive. She walked me through a number of steps and when resets, etc. did not fix the connection problems, she gave me a RMA and shipped me a new unit as well as some foam eartips. The foam tips did WONDERS. I am surprised that they do not include them as an option in the box from the get go (maybe people like me are a very small minority) but they worked really well in keeping the buds in place. They will still come out in extended use (still waiting on a spirit x version of these) but I definitely don't have the same fear that they will fall out at an inopportune time. I still have a few connection issues from time to time and the lack of physical buttons can often be rage inducing so I'm not giving these 5 stars but they are a really good value for the money and from a company that stands behind their product.Original review below:Anker has provided so much value to me over the years (to date, I've bought the soundcore life 2, life q20, spirit X, curve, and an untold amount of cables :D) and I want to love these earbuds so much. There's so much promise and so many features but the sum of it all falls short for me.First off, they look great - as soon as I bought them (my first set of wireless earbuds), people in my office were asking what they were because they looked really sharp. When I am sitting down at my desk and have both of these in, they are really good at blocking out exterior noise which is why I bought them (I work in a refashioned warehouse and the HVAC system and the industrial refrigerators we have create a ton of looping, irritating noise). The ANC is pretty solid for my needs and the sound quality for the podcasts I listen to seems really good.However, the problems arise when I am not using them in that ideal scenario (seated, both buds in). When I have one bud in, the touch controls don't seem to work as well and I have to try a few times for the command to register, if it does at all. This might be a minor quibble as I'm not sure how many people are going into ""mono"" mode but since it is most of my day, it can make the headphones borderline unusable for me. In the same vein, I do like the app (Android) but I hate the widget - whenever I flip to it to switch the hearing modes, it never says the buds are connected...even though they are in my ear and playing music. It defeats the purpose of using a widget because I then have to unlock my phone and do it through the app. Now, I wouldn't have to do it through the app ... if the touch controls worked properly when I had one bud in. It's a cycle of frustration!Finally, the biggest problem for me is that the buds simply do not stay in all the time. especially when I am walking. I have tried several of the covers that they provided in the box and while I get a good seal for listening, I can feel the bud start to slip out of my ear as I am walking. I start panicking that it's going to fall and slam on the stamped concrete floors of the office and I'm going to be out the money I paid for these. If Anker made a spirit X version of these that hooked above the ear, that might be a better choice for me. For now, because of the above frustrations, these have been relegated to just at home use for my wife and I when we are not being active and can have both buds in.","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2021",AHUK67NI4JQRYVD3RJ6YLQEOC47Q,1,104,Color: Navy Blue,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds
944,RJCLBUNTY2E0X,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Very impressive buds for the price,H. Fox,5,"I'm nothing close to being an audiophile, but I use earbuds and headphones of several different brands a lot, in and out of the house. As a 65+ senior with a mild but annoying tinnitus problem, I use my AirPods Pro every time I watch TV at home because, without them, it's very difficult to catch all of the dialogue of almost every program I watch. They sync with my LG TV very well so I don't have to adjust TV settings for video/audio syncing.But this is a review of the Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Earbuds, so why am I talking up the AirPods Pro? Simple. They make for a great comparison. I've owned earlier versions of the Anker Soundcore non-ANC buds that were less expensive, and it showed in their performance. But, I gotta say, the P3 ANCs are way, way better. I don't fly a lot, but recently, on some very long flights from Florida to western Canada, the P3s really shined. The constant noise level in most airliners is terrible and completely wears me out even after short flights. I was skeptical about using earbuds instead of headphones, but I literally couldn't believe my ears when I popped the P3s in and was instantly transformed by the quiet! Their noise canceling performance might not be the very best, but I've tried other brands including Sony, Sennheiser and Bowers-Wilkins and the P3s are truly nearly as good - including my AirPods Pro, which are my all-time favorites for both overall sound quality and ANC. The shocker, of course, is that the P3s are a fraction of the cost.To my problematic ears the sound quality of the P3s isn't quite there, but they are way more than just satisfactory. I would have given them four-and-a-half stars for that aspect, but Amazon won't let me. All around, the P3s are just plain awesome, and at their price point, they're amazing. Oh, and by the way, they work very well with my LG TV also. If I couldn't, or didn't want to, afford the AirPods Pro, the P3s would make me very happy as an alternative.Now for one quibble. The P3s charging case is just plain terrible. Not because they don't protect the buds or charge them properly, but because, in my experience, they're constantly popping open and dropping the P3s at the worst possible moments. The case is SO easy to accidently pop open, that if dropped a mere few inches onto a firm surface, mine would flop open and invariably the earbuds would just fall out. This made for some especially exciting moments on said airline trip to Canada. I nearly lost the P3s several times when they'd fall out of a pocket, or my backpack, and the case would pop open and scatter the buds in different directions. Just try finding two black earbuds on black carpet under your airline seat a couple times - not a pleasant experience. Heads up, Anker! I love a lot of your products, but you could do seriously better designing a case for such great earbuds.","Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2023",AEKYMROIZQIL46DMG3NJLQI6B6MQ,1,32,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

Overall, I'm pretty happy with them.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AFX6OLEWT3FC4RIPPW6SMSAWP6CA,1,0,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds
947,R1F4CL31ULDQW1,B093SLWMS7,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great for price, very strong bass (maybe too strong)",eqrweqe,4,"I revisited these after my Sony WF-1000XM4's started experiencing battery issues and the company wouldn't replace them.Putting them in is still a trick I'm learning to master. I still don't quite get the ""lock"" movement, but once they're in they stay in about as well as any other bud.For the price, the sound quality is essentially the same as the XM4's. Both earbuds needed some fussing with the EQ to get the best profile. The major difference is that while Sony lets you control the bass boost, this one goes full throttle. I had to heavily boost all the other frequencies in the EQ while reducing the lower frequencies to near zero (see screenshot for my recommendation) just to get it to a level I would consider acceptable. Some will like how ungodly strong it is, others will not.Noise canceling seems to be about on par with Sony, but the ambient sound is definitely much worse. The XM4's were clear as day whereas these still sound quite muffled. But the XM4's are a few bennies whereas this is 60 bucks, so you can't really complain too much.Touch controls are responsive, though you might get some accidental presses here and there. The only thing I wish these had was a sensor to automatically pause when you take the earbuds out, but I think I'll live.Bottom line, for 60 bucks these are really good earbuds that can compete with the best, with a few caveats here and there.","Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2024",AG7A23DX5XH3NCQ3THOP3P2LEO5A,1,0,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

955,RFD4WZ3MS8Y2O,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Good value for price - with a catch,StephenH,4,"Briefly, I find these earbuds well worth the price and recommend them. My review is not a comparison of the product to others but the value of my purchase. * Noise cancellation is so-so overall. It's not ""true"" noise cancellation but rather smooths out ambient sounds. For example, the outdoor setting is reasonable for reducing wind noise but does not eliminate it. However, I do not find stark differences between the settings. The app has been updated since my purchase a couple months ago, and my initial experience with noise reduction was better before the update(s). Users can hope for Anker to do more tweaking to improve this feature.* Fit and finish is good. The case seems sturdy and would probably easily withstand a few drops. I like the tip selection and customizing them did improve my experience, although not as dramatically as perhaps advertised. I have slept with these earbuds with no negative consequence. The tap response is satisfactory although requiring something of a firm touch - some users may appreciate this while others might prefer a lighter touch.* The app is easy to navigate and the preset equalizer settings are numerous. The various settings are unique and have a qualitative impact on sound. This is not a situation where the user changes a setting and struggles to hear the difference. I have had no problem with the buds synching with my device or with each other (e.g., one earbud works but the other does not).* Sound quality is good and provides a good range of tones. I am a bit skeptical of the ""big bass,"" but again the setting does have an impact on sound. An audiophile should probably look elsewhere but sound quality will well satisfy most users.* The range - the distance between my device and the earbuds - is good. I am fortunate to live in a larger than average home and do not lose connection unless I am on the opposite end of the house from my device.* I have not used the wireless charging but have no reason to doubt the function. Otherwise, the battery appears to have a long-life; I have yet to experience running out of charge either with the earbuds themselves or with the case. I typically use these a few hours a day and charge the case every few weeks.* I reserve my opinion about using these earbuds on a phone call because I haven't taken a call. However, I have noticed that when my phone rings, the ringtone sounds tinny. This doesn't bode well for calls, although voices - such as audiobooks and podcasts - have a good sound.After two months of use, I recommend these earbuds and would likely buy them again (e.g., should I lose this pair). However, I paid $20 less than the current list price - a $60 purchase - and found it a very good deal. At $80, a consumer might shop a little more and possibly consider their device (Apple v. Android) and preference for better noise cancellation. Nonetheless, the average listener will be satisfied with the purchase even at the higher price point.","Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2022",AGIDTSAC6QLWO5LSJBIZ5CYRG6IA,1,3,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds
956,R1H9WQM7P0JUI,B093SLWMS7,"4.0 out of 5 stars Incredible base, great noise cancellation, needs mute function",Scoobi_FreeBSD,4,"These are my 1st attempt at using an ear bud-style audio device since trying the wired bluetooth kind probably 5 years ago; those had an ear hook wrapped around my ear to hold them in. Other ear buds I've tried would not stay in my ears, so I've been using over-the-ear headphones.These ear buds fit my ears pretty well; the initial rubber cups that go into the ear seemed to fit pretty well; I tried 1 size up and 1 size down, actually went with 1 size up on the left ear. The buds work themselves out of my ears when I'm chewing (not sure if that's a common problem), but otherwise they stay in place fairly well when sitting at my desk (haven't tried them at the gym yet...guess I'll have to start going again).I read the reviews on the great bass response of these buds, they're all true! I was amazed at how realistic the bass was when listening to TV shows (e.g. the scene transition sound in The Big Bang Theory). Noise cancellation is also excellent; when I turn on noise cancellation with the TV on, it's almost like someone hit the mute button (of course it's not perfect and I can still hear the TV). Noise cancellation can be customized using the downloadable mobile app to cancel specific frequencies, or to pass through voice frequencies. Battery life is excellent, lasting at least 5 hours before the buds notify me with ""battery low"" every 5 minutes. One bud will konk out first and the other one several minutes later. I can use the buds with a fully-charged case for several days on a single case charge, using them a few (~2-4) hours per day. Microphones are good quality; I have not had any complaints from people I've been on calls with.The buds are controlled via capacitive touch actions on the main outer body of each bud. There are 3 actions one can perform on each bud - single tap, double tap and long press. Each action can be mapped to one of a number of actions - volume up, volume down, cycle through noise cancellation modes, initiate voice assistant (e.g. Alexa or Google Home), next track, previous track, play/pause. Single tap cannot do voice assistant, as of firmware version 02.61.The case is small, about the size of a plum. I've dropped the case with the ear buds in it a couple times, no noticeable damage, but the ear buds will fly everywhere.My only complaint is with the app and a missing ""mute"" function which can silence all audio from a paired Bluetooth device so I can hear what someone is saying. The app is reasonably user-friendly, and you essentially need it to change noise cancellation mode between all of the available modes (there's 6). Tap actions can only move you between the 3 categories - normal (off), transparency (allow certain frequencies) and noise cancellation. It would be nice if they added a mute/unmute tap action which turns off the audio I'm listening to.","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2021",AFJPI2IAJX2PMC2LL4NMSH5DCX5Q,1,2,Color: Navy Blue,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

967,R2ZXJST4ARM093,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Deal for The Money.,Woody D.,4,"I am a former live sound engineer. To me sound quality is the number one concern. My last two sets of buds were actually sold as in ear monitors for professional musicians. One set were wired Sony's and the other Advanced AD3 wireless with a wire between the buds. Both had excellent sound quality. Since I have not had individual buds before and was afraid of losing one, I decided not to break the bank with my first pair. High end buds go for north of $200. I bought the P3s after doing quite a bit of research.When they arrived they were pretty easy to set up. The app you use with them is pretty simple. It includes a customizable EQ so you can tailor the sound to your liking. I use a ""dog eared"" setting boosting the bass and treble while leaving the midrange flat. The sound is really quite good.I would call the noise cancelling decent but not great. Of course in my opinion the only way you get great cancelling is with full headphones. You have a choice of different NC settings. I find the ""indoor"" setting works the best at the gym to somewhat drown out the music they are playing. I have not tried them on an airplane yet. As I mentioned I was afraid of losing a bud....so much that I leave them in until I get home and dump them in the charging case. When I leave the gym I just switch to the ""Ambient"" sound mode and I can hear the world around me pretty well. The buds work very well for phone calls. My wife says my voice sounds perfect when she calls.The controls on the buds for changing volume or tracks work ok, but are not perfect. At time I find myself just reaching for my phone to change track or adjust volume. That may be more about my gnarly fingers than the buds.I am still trying to get the pairing routine worked out. I have them paired with my phone, tablet and Peloton. I know they are supposed to pair automatically to the primary device, but I find I need to put them into pairing mode most of the time. Once paired they are rock solid....solid as in I left my phone on a machine at the gym, went to the other side of the building and they still worked.The buds fit well in my ears. I don't run, but a sweaty in the saddle, out of the saddle Peloton HIIT ride does not pop them out.The battery life seems good, but honestly I do not wear them more than a couple of hours and the rest of the time they live in their charging case.I would recommend these buds for people who want a pair of bud with good sound and don't want to break the bank to get it.

968,R1445LYQM6ZZRP,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Quality and Comfort for Under $100,E. J.,4,"EDIT: 7/31/21. I really want to love these earbuds, but the audio keeps cutting out consistently when I use them. Iâ€™ve unpaired them from my phone several times, and deleted the device from my phone with no improvement. I still enjoy these earbuds, but I assume they are a faulty set.*Original Review*Iâ€™ve used these earbuds for almost 2 weeks and hereâ€™s my thoughts:1: Great value for the price.I preordered my pair and got a early bird discount code in my email for 20% off the day they launched. I paid around $65 when I purchased them, tax included.2: Very comfortable.These earbuds have a similar fit to AirPods Pro in the way they nestle on the outer edge of the ear canal. I wear the largest size ear tips and they fit securely. They donâ€™t â€œplugâ€ your ears, but thereâ€™s a slight suction to keep them secure with minimal pressure.3: Sound quality is top tier under $100. Compared to AirPods Pro, thereâ€™s richer bass and clarity in my opinion. I achieved this by fiddling with the EQ on the Soundcore app. The default settings are fine, but the sound profile is much more nuanced and not as compressed when you customize it for your taste. I set mine to the R&B preset and customized it.4: Excellent battery life.On my days off I always have my earbuds in listening to YouTube, Apple Music, etc., and they exceeded my expectations. I only had to recharge once every 2-3 days in the time Iâ€™ve had them. The case is fairly quick to charge and the earbuds themselves recharge fast after using them throughout the day.5: Noise cancellation is decent.The noise cancellation is detectable and can be very useful in certain environments, but donâ€™t expect complete silence while using it. The different modes are useful, but I prefer to use the indoor mode the most. I estimate about a 50-60% noise reduction when I listen to my fridge running while using the noise cancellation.6: Instant pairing.When I get ready to use the earbuds, they pair with my phone before I get to put them in my ears. The pairing and connection range is very strong and consistent.I have some small criticisms too, starting with the audio playback.1: Audio can randomly go mute while playing media for 1-2 seconds at random times throughout the day. It happens maybe 3-5 times a day and isnâ€™t intrusive, but can get annoying while you watch videos. I understand this is a new product and hopefully this will get fixed with firmware updates.2: Touch controls can be finicky (operator error)Thereâ€™s a little learning curve to double tap consistently so the earbuds can recognize it. You have to tap near the very top of the earbud stem or it wonâ€™t work. It puts pressure into your ear when you tap and the video or music may not recognize it every time.All things considered, these earbuds are a great choice for anyone balling on a budget that wants quality and comfort for under $100.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2021",AEYPDC22S7GYSMNQB4PTDUYOZYOQ,1,3,Color: Navy Blue,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds
969,R3NDNCKLZM1KJA,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Great pair of PC headsets.,jesus,4,"So I did try to return these. Overall the sound quality is amazing and the sound isolation is not bad. While I'm used to airpods pro 2 and airpods max type of isolation. These are not bad.I mainly bought this as a replacement for my airpods pro 1 generations. As I lost them and find my was not picking up an active trace. I also use both android and iPhone so I wanted a device that essentially runs on both platforms.The case is good with strong magents to hold the ear pieces in. Good sound quality that I think most will enjoy and the features are not too bad.The only issue I had is when I was using them on my phone there was a type of glitch where sound just goes to 100% and I have to click the volume to go back to where it was. What I Mean by this is that let's say I'm watching a video or listen to music at 30% volume. Out of nowhere the audio sounds like it went to 100% which in turn hurts my ears. I then scramble to lower the volume but with one click it goes back to normal. So it wasn't really cranked up to 100% but audio did do that.With this in mind I was in the process with Amazon to return it but while I couldn't return them at the time I figured I'll hold on to them. I went and connected them to my PC and they auto connect and pair and audio plays beautifully. No hickups whatsoever. I think audio though I get more bass and voices like on a discord call while in gameplay is more closer and clear. So like fps games more roomy and bassy but the voice is contrast with clear and close. But overall they are great for PC use. I disabled the touch controls so they are a standalone Bluetooth earpiece that works seamlessly. Once you have put in the other ear in, you are already getting sound from the PC. This is great as while my overhear headsets charge, I use these and audio switches on there own.","Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2023",AFJZZ7GBHNX4QGHEIDLIXCPSXM5A,1,4,Color: Navy Blue,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

These are my absolute favorite pair of earbuds. I purchased a pair of these a year ago after reading a Wirecutter review for earbuds in the lower price range under $100. Amazon had them on a deal and they lived up to the reviews in sound, fit and quality. Then unfortunately I misplaced them. Long story short I unknowingly dropped them getting out my car, found them crushed a month later nearby by either my car or the snow plow, the price to replace was too much, and the hunt was on for new earbud replacements. I tried a few lesser from soundcore but they weren't P3s and a few other brands but they didn't have the sound or fit I enjoyed with the Life P3s. If you want earbuds to stay in your ears while eating, bending down, exercising, or just sitting with clear sound and listening to music like it's playing live in front of you, Life P3s are the buds. These were on a ""Deal"" again on Amazon and I didn't hesitate to reorder a new set and it's worth every penny.","Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2024",AH5U2AFL4OBYCKWXHYFZITVOGATA,1,0,Color: Coral Red,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds
977,R1RXY2NUDI9XU9,B093SLWMS7,4.0 out of 5 stars Battery Life is Amazing,Corey Helwig,4,"Iâ€™m going to compare these to the Apple AirPods Pro, because thatâ€™s what these are replacing for me.I enjoyed my AirPods. But the battery life started off not great, and over time, the earbuds developed some crackling. Finally decided to replace them and these earbuds are what I ordered.The last month or so I used the AirPods, I had to recharge the pack pretty much everyday. The earbuds would drain quickly, Iâ€™d put them back in the the charging case, and the entire charge would be gone within 24 hours.I received these exactly 1 month ago as I write this review. I use these earbuds the same amount I used my AirPods, and Iâ€™m only just now having to plug the case in to recharge it. Itâ€™s completely blown away all my expectations.The sound quality is also much better than the AirPods. The earpieces fit in more securely, and they are equally, if not slightly more comfortable than the AirPods were. I like a lot of bass with my music and these do not disappoint. All around real great quality product and way worth the money.My main criticism is that, compared to the AirPods, the transparency modes leave something to be desired. With the AirPods, I was able to have them in, and be able to hear people talking to me, if I needed to, with the music still playing. With these, I can hear someoneâ€™s voice if theyâ€™re talking to me, but Iâ€™d have to pause whatever Iâ€™m listening to in order to actually hear them. And even at that, the voices still sound muffled in all different transparency modes. So not a dealbreaker, but definitely a little bit of a pain in that regard.","Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2023",AG6DAEYFKBXXPIPY743LLOZYNDCQ,1,14,Color: Black,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds

984,R3UCFTICRF5BY0,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic earbuds,A Maurer,5,"Our office rearranged the floor plan and I suddenly found myself sitting next to people who are on the phone all day long. I needed some noise canceling earbuds that would block the background noise without costing me $300. Iâ€™ve previously had first gen AirPods and my hustband has the Bose quiet comfort so I had something to compare these to. I also bought a pair of noise canceling jbl earbuds as well as the anker liberty 4 so I could try out multiple and pick which ones I like best.These were the winner for multiple reasons! First off, I genuinely like the look of these over all others I tried (Bose included). The oat white looks expensive and is discrete. Secondly, these fit my ears the best. I have small ears apparently, and the jbls and my husbands Bose quiet comfort were too large and fell out if I turned my head. I found that the anker liberty 4s were slightly more bulky which is part of the reason I ultimately chose these. Thirdly, you canâ€™t beat the price of these. I got a lightning deal that made these only $50. And finally, noise cancellation and sound quality are great! The liberty 4s and Bose block more noise but this was the right amount for me and I like that there are different modes.Highly recommend these! Definitely would not purchase another pair of AirPods again after how great these are!","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2024",AHYOBRQSTP3SP6JITEAFUXQF53UQ,1,0,Color: Oat White,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds
985,R2Y5DU2M35KAFY,B093SLWMS7,5.0 out of 5 stars Doesn't hurt and holds a charge forever,Failed frugalness,5,"I have gone through so many headphones and earbuds. Even my shokz that don't really go on or in your ears would end up hurting after a bit. I was beginning to think I'd never be able to have Bluetooth earbuds because the weight of them was too much or they fit in such a way as to almost instantly hurt. I've had these for almost a year now. After about 7 months they started falling out more so I got the silicone tips that have sort of 2 layers to them and they stay in well. The thing is, I can wear them all day doing the shopping so I don't have to listen to Mariah sing about Christmas or elevator music, and my ears don't hurt at all. These are the first ones I've ever had that I could say that. I also have only charged the case 4 times since I bought them, and only one of those times did it get below 2 dots out of 3 for the charge! The earbuds themselves have never batted an eye at a 2 hour or more outing either.Granted, the noise blocking isn't amazing but it is fine I think. My son is a musician and he says they are ok, but not amazing. I am not as picky as he is though and I think they sound pretty good. The microphone is a typical Bluetooth microphone. People can hear and understand me most of the time but occasionally it gets overloaded by nearby noise or something and I have to use the phone directly.Overall I think they were absolutely worth it. I don't like to give 5 star reviews because I distrust most of them. I can't really think of a reason to discount one star though unless it is because they don't have the same quality as earbuds that cost more than double what these are...but nobody expects them to!","Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2023",AGMX3WQBFSL2JBKSCJFGHC4PCUQQ,1,17,,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds
986,R3TB7QMD4XGCVK,B093SLWMS7,"4.0 out of 5 stars Works well, IF you can get them to fit!",RJM,4,"These buds sound okay, but thatâ€™s not why I bought the P3â€™s. My wife snores, and I needed some way to keep my marriage intact.Previously, I had a very old pair of Bose noise cancelling wired earbuds, but the battery died, and Bose is just too expensive. So I know what good noise cancelling is like, but I wanted something at a more reasonable price point.I was pleasantly surprised at the cancelling performance of the P3 earbuds, and the battery life in noise cancelling when youâ€™re not playing music.Unfortunately, there is one problem.: the stock mushroom heads of the P3â€™s are utterly terrible. You need a good seal in your ear for the cancelling to work, and the design of the stock tips is poor. The various sizes donâ€™t work for different reasons: either they are too small, or they deform in a way that doesnâ€™t make a good seal. I think the engineers at Anker spent almost no time on the ergonomic design.Fortunately, though, I have many after market and leftover mushroom tips and I found one set that isâ€¦ well, better. I still have to keep pushing the earbuds back into my ear holes because they work loose, but I can live with that.Not that anyone will listen, but a future version of these buds should go a little deeper into your ear, and perhaps the rubber could be slightly higher density. Just as a side note, you can buy longer mushroom tips that work okay, but then the earbuds wonâ€™t fit in the charger.

I havenâ€™t tested the ANC bc I donâ€™t really use the feature but I do need the noise isolation and its very good. I wish I never wasted the money I did on Apple AirPods. These are a much better value and have no bugs.The things that I donâ€™t like about these:There is a delay when you use the touch sensitive controls, which is just the section of the earbud with the logo. Itâ€™s not the stem. You press the logo and thereâ€™s a half second delay before it takes effect. When you have to double press it makes you wonder if it worked or not. There is a setting in the app to make an audible chime when you press a button. I enabled that and it helps a little. I just wish it was a little faster.The lid on the case is a little flimsy and isnâ€™t held by a magnet. Itâ€™s just a spring loaded hinge.The sound profile is bass heavy. Adjust the highs up in the EQ in the app and it fixed it.Overall Iâ€™m very happy with them! Oh and the battery life is good, at least without ANC on. I listened to them for at least 4-5 hours straight no problem and the battery gauge said it used about half.

I was looking for some â€œpretty darn awesomeâ€ sub-$100 ear buds and these are the ones Iâ€™ve minded on. My last pair finally died. I used them daily for the last 3 years and they have been beaten up, lost, found again, etc. I love the Anker products as my go-to for after market tech products without breaking the bank. The sound is much higher than the price point. They are somewhat customizable for sound and gestures to control them. They cancel noise pretty good but arenâ€™t $400 Bose or other big name brand. Iâ€™d give the noise cancellation a 8.75 or 9 on a 1-10 scale.

991,R2ZJ6GUWDRCM2J,B093SLWMS7,"5.0 out of 5 stars Wow, just wow",Avalon,5,"Preface: I have the Sony XM4 buds right now. Not the XM3, the XM4, the brand new ones. They are the BEST sounding true wireless earbuds I have had thus far, and their battery life is no joke, I canâ€™t kill it. Their current base price is $279.99. (I purchased them for that price)I got the Life P3 for school and just general listening because I didnâ€™t want to risk losing or having my Sonyâ€™s stolen. When I paired and started listening to these earbuds, I couldnâ€™t believe how good they sounded. I actually am starting to have some buyerâ€™s remorse. I like the design of both the buds and the case, theyâ€™re quite sleek and compact. I selected the light blue color, since I donâ€™t like how darker colors show oil from my skin. They fit great and create a good seal which is vital for the best potential bass response. The bass on these buds is no joke, and thatâ€™s coming from Soundcores Signature sound profile, meaning the standard equalizer setting, no customization. Bass is responsive without being too dirty or uncontrolled, mids (where vocals live) are present and clear, and highs are reproduced well without being too sharp. Of course they donâ€™t have the same soundstage or clarity/sharpness as the Sonyâ€™s, but for less than a third of the price itâ€™s almost laughable at how good these buds are by comparison. Let me give you some of my credentials. Iâ€™ve had the:-Sony XM3 & XM4 buds-AirPod Pro-Jabra Elite 75t-Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2-Master & Dynamics MW08All of these are some of the best if not the best these manufacturers offer. Music is incredibly important to me and my development as a human being, so I take my sound experience very seriously, doing thorough research and actual hardware/software testing. My three points for a great pair of buds for me is sound/battery/fit. I often listen to music in bed, so fit is important not just for bass. These buds stay in place no problem. The Life P3 companion app by Soundcore is also incredibly useful and modern in its aesthetics and overall design language. It puts the most important settings right in front without being flashy or gimmicky. A great overall experience both for the hardware and software.In short, if you want a great pair of wireless earbuds with great customizable sound, great fit with multiple eartip sizes included in box, good battery life with a case that has wireless charging, and a great app/software experience, look no further. YOU FOUND IT! A great accomplishment for Soundcore and one of the best audio values for consumers.","Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2021",AF662MI774VTXQP3NF5CBQGDF7XQ,1,0,,Soundcore by Anker Life P3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds
